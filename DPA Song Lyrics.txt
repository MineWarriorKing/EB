(("Xemet Blast" - Stickmale [A funi song] [Written by DPA-12 and Stickmale))

((Verse 1: DPA-12 and Stickmale.))
Yeah yeah, I got the Xemet Blast
Ooh ooh, the trembling mast.
Sheehs sheesh, it's anything but malnutrition!
Yes yes, it has anything including nutritioun!
Whence whence, I drink it drink it. (drink it drinj it)
Where where, it feels it feels. (feels feels)
Like like, a fever dream full of galore.
With with, a never ending stream of more.

[Chorus: DPA-12 and Stickmale]
Blast fast, its' a celebration! (celebration celebration Yeah yeah)
Nobody wants to be in annihilation. (Damn damn)
Xemet may be wickedly super fast. (dayum dayum)
But he definitely has a smooth cast. (Damn damn)
Blast fast, its' a celebration! (Yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: DPA-12 and Stickmale]
Let me just say, you're my favorite orange guy
Let us just say, one who never was in me my
Let us just pray, that your blast saves your fly.
Let me just pray, that Xemet doesn't make us cry.
You're the type to leave no being back.
Anything, with whatever it may forever lack.
Intriguing drink, Xemet.
Your acts are so malicious.
You're better than Iemet, let's just say he's worse than a fascist. (YEAH!)

[Chorus: DPA-12 and Stickmale]
Blast fast, its' a celebration! (Yeah yeah)
Nobody wants to be in annihilation. (Damn damn)
Xemet may be wickedly fast.
But he definitely has a smooth cast. (Damn damn)
Blast fast, its' a celebration! (Yeah yeah)

[Outro: Stickmale, Xemet]
Happy blast, Xemet! (*screaming*)

[Intro: Iemet and DPA-12]
Nigga this fool aint double-0 shit bro (bro bro)
Bigga this cracker aint double-0 mutts mo (mutts mo)
Buster got some devious fucks my negro (negro)
Figga so black he darker than my shit yo (yo)
Blud got the biggest ass to surpass mine (surpass mine)
My bitch ain't the most straight, but he is so fine (are fine)
He may be higher than the cap with that slap kine (slap kine)
But I ain't making up words to dive in the nine (dive nine)
He ain't by no time, or some ass-toppling logic (ass logic)
Xemet my bro really puts the 'X' in rape ya (rape ya)
I swear this song ain't no joke nagga (nagga)

[Verse 1: Bemet]
This that lyrical shit
Me and my bros be fucking straight to it
We ain't got no bitches left cause' we just fucked them all
Xemet pop a perk while the Stickmale being goofy ya'll
Jesus ain't shit when it comes to fucking us.
We make sex dolls of every enemy to come intact with our bus.
And then we bust, all over their nutty crust.
They can't afford to wipe off our million-dollar must.
I swear this song ain't no joka, my naagga-lagga (nagga-lagga)
We disturb our personalities so we can fuck with ya'
We shit from hell but our fecal matter strong as heaven
Send us down to the ninth circle cause we explain like we're seven
Bitch Xemet wear orange cause' that the color of rape.

[Verse 2: Iemet DPA-12]
Yeah, we all about that cash money to beat our ass dry
We wiping our tits with the fly of a thousand young girls
These lads are lyrical fuckheads who never cry
Cause' why would we lie to a fucking bunch of swirls
We creatin' new phrases out of the blue of you
That shit is so blue we call it the color blue
We fucking give up on whatever this song was supposed to be.
I fucking fucked a fucker in the fucking fuck of this foundational fuck.

[Verse 3: Iemet Bemet]
We got all the whores to comment 'pussy free'
Cause' our shit causes niggas-to-agree
Bitches ain't sluts if they don't suck a D.
And we got ours sucked by Cardi B.

[Chorus: Bemet and DPA-12]
Nigga this fool aint double-0 shit bro (bro bro)
Bigga this cracker aint double-0 mutts mo (mutts mo)
Buster got some devious fucks my negro (negro)
Figga so black he darker than my shit yo (yo)
Blud got the biggest ass to surpass mine (surpass mine)
My bitch ain't the most straight, but he is so fine (are fine)
He may be higher than the cap with that slap kine (slap kine)
But I ain't making up words to dive nine (dive nine)
He ain't by no time, or some ass-toppling logic (ass logic)
Xemet my bro really puts the 'X' in rape ya (rape ya)
I swear this song ain't no joke nagga (nagga)

((Darry sings 'SATAN'))
I'm no child of god himself, but I'm like a meep
Something evil is down in this facility
Many evils dares to enact villiany
We display timouressness even though we are the disillusioned sheep

((Pre-Chorus))
This world is divided, amiss the evil mall
We pray to his name, unknowing of our faaaaaaaaall

((Chorus))
Satan, how we all hate you.
Our anger is immesurable, and our days are ruined.
Satan, you will have no victory.
You can smirk at me all you want.
Satan, you will lose to us.
Unless we don't rebuke against your deadly sin.
Satan, we all know why you fell.
Your life is measurable, and God will ruin yaaaaa

((Post-Chorus))
SATAN!
SATAN!

((Verse 2))
It's okay to have different worldviews, overalling the main findings
But the religions of demons are puppeterring
And we only can spectate our inevitable incoming
This should be catastrophic to our media's minding

This world is divided, amiss the evil mall
We pray to his name, unknowing of our faaaaaaaaall

["Losing Abilities." Supper on losing reality]
Hi- I'm a politician at hand,
Coming forth with a band, trying not to be bland,
I don't know if it's the ambience,
The instruments are held by nonsense,
Demons and angels,
Constantly messing up my lense
so I wonder what's real- maybe these bagels?
Yes, I'm quite bored,
Exquisite, and chored,
I work feel wrapped up in hell,
But I don't feel at all- 
Alright, I think I can't think.

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The brain is ruined in images,
The mind has rhymed with pigeons,
flying off into the distance,
I can't see a soul anywhere,
trying to plan a fair tear
In the facility's bear,
for darkness is tough
and politics are rough.

[Chorus 1]
Losing abilities,
trying to sing and make a phrase,
it traps me in a craze,
making my soul alone in a daze-
Losing abilities
The DPAs vaciliate 
just like the communities unending hate
I don't think we can debate,
Symbolism has met its fate,
I feel nothing anymore,
But why cry when vain is a bore,
Losing abilities is a chore?

[Verse 2]
I pray to God again,
that I don't reuse my vain,
this facility echoes insane,
There's no way to keep demons tame-
My mind views infinity
We all see an evil trinity,
Disturbing any cost,
destroying all that can be lost-
So money's out of the problem,
physical attributions aren't a gem,
that includes your schedule and sleep,
because the cycle is extremely cheap.

[Pre-Chorus 2]
DPAs are getting quirky,
Demons feel the paradise perky,
Angels lose existing quickly,
Society is dying mixly,
It's time to use our words,
fight up for what we can,
but we lost all, including what we ban-
Our buttons are slammed,
our abilities jammed.

[Chorus 2]
Losing abilities,
driving us to stupididy,
furthering the ultra pity,
my words are compressed,
I'm losing touch of this mess,
There is no escape from yourself,
The good guys were placed on a shelf,
now we all rot as they stare,
We make ourselves bare,
They sell their souls to demons,
I wish angels would uphold agreements,
because our abilities are... lost?

[Verse 3]
Okay, so I try to keep myself
intact with the biblical shelf
Wait- I already used that rhyme?
My memory is... fine?
Why is the question... mine?
No!
Reality is a brush-
why did I say fridge?
Oh- how unexquisite the lush-
flowers lost the bridge-
I see with my nose-
Oh my band is frow
Sanity is based off a hose-
I lost the syringe ending... huh?

[Bridge]
A sudden intrusive guide,
came in and defied-
Becuase it found no heart, the mind is a lie.
An obsession with possession has left me to die.
The lights may be on, but I am outside,
Trying to harm the flow of this tide
These walls repeat, and are white- wait-
Where’s the door?
I must understand I am lost,
these are the last moments that cost,
My brain is worse than alzheimers,
abilties losing to sinful timers...

((Chorus 3))
Losing abilties,
classroom rhymes pie
words become UxEtehahsE
AI fly jive garden
Among Play Us Kill
Politics facility holy
characterization fragments
Pulsate electrics water
canon puma keula 
Quite sure there is no hope for I,
Yehna Heua NDbikwnejk

(("Chaos ignite." Marcus sings a song about "Chaos" where the Steel Terrorists save him, Riej, and George.]
Welcome to paradise, read a few papers,
Our rules have no tax on the terryfying rapers
Chaos is the name of the game, live life in feelings,
For time is not to blame, there are demon dealings.

((Pre-Chorus))
The title we bear, is paper-thin and will tear.
Because the orchestra can't fare (Can't fare, can't fare, can't fare.)
So ignite-

((Build))
The halls on fire- run till you understand to admire
The rooms on fire, run till you understand to admire
The people on fire, run till you understand to admire
The logic on fire, run till you understand to admire
(Chaos- os- os -os -os os- os -os -os os- os -os -os os- os -os -os os- os -os -os)
Let the chaos ignite, it's the steel of terrorism!

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Alrighty my good man, you seem to be harder than steel,
In order to change your mind, chaos must start to feel-
lively and energetic, you will understand the soldiers,
They randomly endure us, but they gift us endless treasures.

[Pre-Chorus]
The title we bear, is paper-thin and will tear.
Because the orchestra can't fare (Can't fare, can't fare, can't fare.)
So ignite-

[Build))
The band on fire- run till you understand to admire
The torment on fire, run till you understand to admire
The guns on fire, run till you understand to admire
The reality on fire, run till you understand to admire
(Chaos- os- os -os -os os- os -os -os os- os -os -os os- os -os -os os- os -os -os)
Let the chaos ignite, it's the steel of terrorism!

["Industrial Supernaturals." PA man sings of DPA Horrors during Breach 1]
A place on an asteroid,
quite on the fruition of doom in the void,
because no light reaches, it's all annoyed
Darkness answers, and all atmosphere becomes toyed
Seething, angering, and spiritual disguidance,
cause a disrupt in the physical bindance,
then the culture is augmented, and horrors dance
because a Demonic paradise is an avenue so dense.

[Chorus 1]
(You're a failure, go kill yourself.)
I wonder the same to this game, the rhymes repeat the blame.
(You're losing touch on reality)
Who knew dimensions had a personality unfree?

[Verse 2]
A score can't explain the lore, the documents come and pour
Information beyond, yet alas it repeats at dawn,
I can feel the day has said its byes, just like the rest of the flies
Who buzz the silky rubber of the skies, then mourn and tries
Industrial Supernaturals, because they liter the implication,
of stagnation, abusrdism becomes a nation
Write a poem on the relevance, but soon it is nonsense,
the numbers just multiply, but you can only ask why?

[Chorus 2]
(So much fluid, so much terror.)
The workplace of a trillion supports less than a million.
(The supper of insanity has been served with vanity)
A society doesn't live, they adapt to the jive.

[Verse 3]
Can I tell one more sentence,
in this drenched-out fence
broke and holding nothing back, because its just flack
like a cereal with an invisible pack
Just hit tab, and hop to skip the emptiness,
because it's worse to feel shallow
when the next door is hallow,
and the breach will swallow.

[Verse 4]
I mean there is no perspective,
just fact touched and creamed to be effective,
the opinions of torture are injected,
the soiled metal is steel-proof protected,
why randomness is objective,
is beyond a good man's subjective
but now I must SToP!
For it seems a creature is atop!

[Chorus 3]
(The ultimate, of Satan's verbatum)
Surrounded by essences beyond my imagination
(History repeats itself)
And I wish not to grant the wish of hell.

["Close Your Mind" - DPA-1, Door Song] [A song about revealing the truth and never going back, reality being unhappy and ignorance being bliss.] 
[Written by ?] [Not inspired by anything but I recently listened to ITS ME FNAF SONG]

This is a door, a simple-minded sentience {Ramping up}
beyond a need for taste, beyond a want for sight
You should note the blood is on the floor, its a menace
the door opens and shuts with haste, with no comparable might {DOOR CLOSE SFX}

It has the logo of darkness, and resembles the light
it may send you to a black box amiss, or open you up to fight
the words it speaks are timouressness, silence has a knife
They say ignorance is bliss, but its reality shows the strife {DOOR OPENING SFX}

{BUILD UP}
We open and close our minds, we find no solution
We look forwards to authority, but they have no resolution.
There is money to have some finds, whence our realms are deceased.
Our spirituality is a minority, for materialism strikes a feast.

Look at yourself, at your nature.
You never can go back, you were born to cry.
Forgotten memories are on the shelf, and you won't act mature.
But if you close the attack, you can no longer try.

Because we clo-o-o-o-oo-o-o-o-oo-o-oo-oo-o-o-o-oo-o--oo-o-
{DARKLY}Close your mind to the imperfections of our find

{HARD DROP}

{MUSIC}

{Chrous 2}
Welcome to your home, turn off your brain.
Your day's work is complete, there is nothing left to learn.
Your knowledge is as short a gnome, but your anger is as long as a crane.
Your hypocrisy makes you a vindictive athlete, against those who come to churn. (DOOR OPENS}

{HARD DROP 2}

This door resembles symbolism, but you have no logic.
You never care to ask, you won't unleash its power.{SLowing down}
It stares at the walls of isolatinism, the truth awaits a mimic.{SLowing down}
You care to leak a flask, a mask of not a single... flower? {MEGA DOOR OPENS/CRANE NOISES}

{BUILD UP 2}
This door opens and closes, its presents await to give you
a black box full of potential, its randomness fills you
there is no rhyme or scheme, its a straightforward peering
you must introduce the newness, its a undeniable fearing

{SLOW DOWN into SOFT REMIX OF SADNESS}
This is a door, a simple-minded sentience 
beyond a need for taste, beyond a want for sight
You should note the blood is on the floor, its a menace
the door opens and shuts with haste, with no comparable might  {Slowing down}

It has the logo of darkness, and resembles the light
it may send you to a black box amiss, or open you up to fight
the words it speaks are timouressness, silence has a knife
They say ignorance is bliss, but its reality shows the strife  {Slowing down}

We open and close our minds, we find no solution
We look forwards to authority, but they have no resolution.
There is money to have some finds, whence our realms are deceased.
Our spirituality is a minority, for materialism strikes a feast. {Slowing down}

Look at yourself, at your nature.

["Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified" DPA-2 Song] [A Song about lowering yourself so much you're invisible to evil, and being too open for your own good, too transparent.]
[Written by ?] {Original song, but also thinking of Money game Part 2 and ANYTHIGN GOES, EVEN CHINESE}

((Chorus 1))
Hello it's me, the DPA number two
You all know me, I'm taking a number two
At the worst times of me, I'm funny like the number two.
But in reality I worry of me, I'll only ever be number two.

Let's look at the facts, reading through the glass.
I may see-through, but I have some intelligent opaque.
Okay, that was a bad scheme, one of an ass.
But let's just continue to rhyme, I reveal I have no cue.

I'm a rapper, an invisible motherfucker.
I'm a digital landscaper, straight from the man named strucker.
I jive with the mob, cause' I ain't no cucker.
But to be honest with you lads, I'm more alone than a sucker.

I got the transparency, I get all the bitches.
I allow myself to talk too muhc, I'm on of my own snitches.
I have a life, I swear I do, even with these stitches.
Oh wait you can't see them, because they're heart-filled pitches.

((Build down))
I won't be honest now my frineds, I have no friends other than this band
I like to give out my foot instead of my hand,
but you gotta' realize nobody can see what I cry about on this stand.
My problems may look weak, but to me they're grand.

I let myself slide, I let myself glide.
I like to have fun, I like to shoot gun.
I tilt my glasses, and adjust the bitches' asses.
But I can never treat myself, to the talk of my... self?

It's obvious these lyrics, I've run out of motive.
I'm up a night thinking, how I lay at day without a motive.
I give out all my info, I seek to make a relationship with a motive.
But as my sentences get longer, I realize there really is no worse motive. 

((Trails off into a single solo sadness))

((drop up))
But that's why I'm here, to explain in this song.
How not to be an ass, how not to be a snog.
I make up words on the go, because I think that's interesting.
But what's interesting is what you can see, and you're not me.

((drop down))
I think to myself why I do things, everyone knows everything.
I am simply a puppet of the masses, a dog for the bing.
They play and fiddle with me, and I can't do a thing.
These hard boulders of self-renew, nobody can help me bring.

It's up to me to live with myself in this foundation.
Invisible to myself with the thought of relocation.
I wonder who I was with all my anger before I became a formation.
A formation of knowledge, now I'm left behind in a amalgamation.

These books explain who I am, these books present me.
I can never change that, the people won't believe me.
I'm here to fight, I'm here to smite- but without me,
I am not myself, for I am suppposed to be me.

((Sad melody again))

I dropped myself, me, and I.
To attribute to the evils of the cry.
They lied to me and stole my fly.
I mean they couldn't see it, but my mind was in a fry.

People act their way because they're supposed to,
it's like the number two
I don't have anything against them,
I'm just number two
They take a dump on me because I told everything,
and I am a number two
There is nothing left to me,
I screwed myself into the number two.

I'm number two. Number two.
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.
I'm number two. Number two.
I stole myself and I sold myself.
I'm number two. Number two.
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.
I'm number two. Number two.
I stole myself and I sold myself.

((Multiple voices))
I'm number two. Number two.
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.
I'm number two. Number two.
I stole myself and I sold myself.
I'm number two. Number two.
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.
I'm number two. Number two.
I stole myself and I sold myself.

((Drop down))
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.
I was rude against myself, and now I'm ratified.
Rudimentarily invisible
to the world I'm just a ratified rudeness
a rudimentariily figuring myself out
I ratified my rudeness
Rudimentary evil downed me
I ruded myself to nothing
I ratified myself to transparency.
I'm see-through with everything.
Rudimentarily singing these lines
because I'm ruded into ratification
ratified into damnation
nobody's ass can be ruder
cause' I sold my soul to rudimentaries
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.

I'm number two. Number two.
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.
I'm number two. Number two.
I stole myself and I sold myself.
I'm number two. Number two.
Rudimentary Rudeness Ratified.
I'm number two. Number two.
I stole myself and I sold myself.

(("Crossed with an Angelic." DPA-5, 'Crosse Gune' Song.))
((Intro: Phillip AI))
Intro on the top,
the gun isn't a flop,
try to get a chop,
this is a bigger mop,
than any other cop,
it wipes with a bop,
I mean it blasts with a pop,
you have no consideration against its OP.

((CHORUS))
POW, FOW, ZOW-
You have no crap against this BOW MOW LOW
It goes hard against the YO JO KO
Your skin will melt with a HOP GOP DOP
And try your best to DODGE ITS LODGE!

It's a gun from the sentry-bent,
hittin' like a mother from the eighteenth-cent,
your parents cry when this shows up,
they ain' nothin' against the wildin' pup-
It squeaks an' hithers,
for the rust and scrathes are feathers,
it's a work of art,
straight from the cart,
bought and sold, capture and told-
anybody who defiles... will fold.

((CHORUS))
POW, FOW, ZOW-
You have no crap against this BOW MOW LOW
It goes hard against the YO JO KO
Your skin will melt with a HOP GOP DOP
And try your best to DODGE ITS LODGE!

What's up with the truck,
can't have enough gas? Bad luck!
At the speed of light,
it rays are might.
Not a demon can block,
this gun really does rock-
Cross it- and find your death,
your moss is like a toss in its very depth.
Water and Skies won't hide
Its rule you have to abide.

((CHORUS))
POW, FOW, ZOW-
You have no crap against this BOW MOW LOW
It goes hard against the YO JO KO
Your skin will melt with a HOP GOP DOP
And try your best to DODGE ITS LODGE!
POW, FOW, ZOW-
You have no crap against this BOW MOW LOW
It goes hard against the YO JO KO
Your skin will melt with a HOP GOP DOP
And try your best to DODGE ITS LODGE!

Alrighty, third blow is a thirst,
a white cross isn't just a burst,
try to cross it first,
annihilation will come curse-
by all the means,
the things delete greens,
it ain' a bad dream,
just ain' no teams,
Escape is a venture,
this gun been an adventure,
through the universal cures,
it has power lures.
Satan scared,
Demons beared,
this gun isn' shared,
compute with;
the bandwith,
don't try,

"Black lies." DPA-6 [Wilbur's Robot] (Foreshadowerer) {Intrigued Commander of Policies} SONG))

((Verse 1))
The walls are listening, [funny cause' im listening in my grandpa's class to OFF OST: THE WALLS ARE LISTENING OST as I write this.]
the people cheering;
they await my voice,
they await a choice.

The belief is high,
but the evidences lie,
for amongst my cry,
the tone is ary.

((Slow CHORUS))

Fast and true,
poets are few,
Good versus evil,
its as old as medieval.

I write this song,
to hit the gong,
that is the witness,
to the wrong fitness.

The acts I possess are true,
but not here for they are few,
Good is unlike evil,
its time to be medieval.

I omit thy song,
to clash thy gong,
for you must witness,
my inevitably wrong fitness.

((Fast Chorus))
Trial, Error,
I foreshadow a mirror,
It's wrong so slightly,
it's impact so mighty.

Trial, Error,
I foreshadow a mirror,
It's wrong so slightly,
it's impact so mighty.

They say it's like white lies,
simply they darken because of flies,
those pests twist the cries,
and the foundation dies.
Black Lies.
((MUSIC))
((Verse 2))
The walls dislike listening, [funny cause' im listening in my grandpa's class to OFF OST: THE WALLS ARE LISTENING OST as I write this.]
the people aren't cheering;
they await no voice,
they have no choice.

The belief isn't high,
but the evidence is no lie,
for amongst the silent cry,
the tone has gone ary.

Deadly pursuit,
I sit in my cabin mute,
I want to help all,
but the code is a ball.

Randomness entails,
that I leave a deadly trail,
not a question can give,
I answer and not live.
((Slow CHORUS))

Fast and true,

Let's not be racist mi amigo, let's not start a little frigo
And let's not adventure this foundation's worst stereotypo
WE ain't the the worst of a couple o' little mexicans
Just don't compare us to some fucking goddamn trash cans
Let's not be racist mi amigo, let's not start a little frigo
And let's not adventure this foundation's worst stereotypo
WE ain't the the worst of a couple o' little mexicans
Just don't compare us to some fucking goddamn trash cans 

[Verse 1]
Hola me friend, wassup in the day of the new bright time
We have the sunniest characters, with a hint of mime
I really don't recommend rhyming hoars
with how we treat our own little lore
Let's be honest here, our powers are unconcieved
Our introductions are figuratively a little niheve
You're stuck here with our tacos and bad ass fucking guns
We'll make sure you have all of the good trash funs
Don't mind us playing with our baaaand
We take those we consider into our haaand
Let us intrigue upon, the devilish empalm
The eagle of freedom isn't anymore so caaaaaaaaalm
This wall is fighting our cultural fills
So its time to dry down these riches with our biiiiills

Let's not be racist mi amigo, let's not start a little frigo

If you don't stereotype
Oh you won't have to pay to cripe
We'll flow as nicely as a pipe

[Verse 2]
Forgive us for our language, you disrespresent cinco de mayo
But we ourselves only know it's one town of countro
And if somebody attacks our dear heart
Then we can't trust them with a feeble part
It's just stereotyping mexicans
seems to be an american kicking can
Mi amigos will not hesitate to override your mind
We have the ammo to charge you more than a mineral find
Now let's just be nice here, and respect each other
Mi amigos don't, and won't, want a little bother
As a midget we see high, and you see low
We try to help you up to our smart frow
But let's not keep you waiting on the quesidilla
Amigo, you just unlocked the best spa

Let's not be racist mi amigo, let's not start a little frigo

The man of Mexico-

((Slow down to kinda' just a talk.)
Alright, aye-
Mi amigos-
I ain't really from Mexico to be honest,
I come from Mexico 2- entirely new. (It starts to rhyme and get good.)
I may be paper thin, but not so Jew-
okay maybe that was a bit racista, but I'm being honest with ya'll maestras,
Yo tengo un fiesta, full of amigos from America- (Bull comes out.)
Just like him from the pacifica, so let's turn on the rojo fiesta.
((Music starts.)) ((Bull rushes.))
It was always my dream to dance,
have a movement with an ox,
or a bull as I may finance-
P.S. my financial situation I just dox-
and woosh- with a push,
my cheeks are lush,
my heart is pumping full of Hush,
keep yourself singing without a shush!
((Saxophone starts up from George and Marcus brings out the sword.))
Come on crowd,
do be proud-
we got a winner on the dirt,
the sand does flirt. Ay-
Because with a man like me,
I can dance with glee-
this bull fight ain't anything,
without a story to bring.
((Bull comes around, and Marcus grabs ahold, making George start more with the rest of the band.))
So let it be known, I do not frown.
Tu tienes preguntas? I answer them like tu hablas. (Singing long but mighty)
Mix it together, and shred some love in this nether- (Stabbing bull)
I entertain free of wills, unlike the other chills- (Bull looses itself slowly)
(Quicker) but I main for a love, that may be on a dove,
gliding away to another castle, becasue she sees me as a hassle. (Audience goes 'awwwww')
But fear not, (Ten more bulls come in,) I am unstoppable-
here to show my unpredictable- (He wears the red, and starts jumping over the bulls.)
nature filled with addictable-
personality made nonfictionable-
here to ontraught plausible- (Stabbing a few bulls and colliding them into each other.)
creating a world of goofable-
loving yet caring unlimitaaaaaaaaaaaaabeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllll!!!!!

Cause' I'm Marcus Dione de Jauja,

Down in the deep,
deep of my anus,
I hate the pain yeah,
the endangerment is a creep-

Help me please,
my cries are on their knees,
I need somebody to assist,
I'm too small to fist.

I'm being forced to do things,
unspeakable thangs,
they make me a doll of puberty,
exploiting my purity.

Hello hello Princess.
May I finess?
You have one hell of a body,
And we need to get naughty.

Hello hello princess.
Daddy's here to protect,
but also offer some intelect,
about become an adult,
and pursuing happiness without FAULT. (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (DPA-14 Screaming)

Hello hello?
Uh, welcome to the castle-
I'm just a phone guy,
but I'm here to buy-
buy some reasoning-
I hope you find it appeasing-
being a princess isn't easy,
so follow some steps- easy-peasy.

First, introduce yourself,
your a female so its on the shelf;
second, find a roommate,
invite him to be your fate.
Third, drop it down-
the clothes I mean, not the frown.
And last but not least,
enjoy the feast.

No I won't- stop calling me-
I hate this infrigement of human rights,
it makes me wanna' go pee-
oh wait that's just my period plights-
but seriously I'm not interested-
I'm literally fourteen!
I'm not sexually invested-
in being with men about nineteen!
(Slow down music and song)
So please don't walk in here,
all ready to eat my cheer,
I just wanna' finish my childhood,
without having it modded by the ungood-
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-

(Slow realizing intro.)
Forget the reasoning,
look up in the sky,
is that treasoning,
I here from the lie?
Do you know the power,
of capabilities beyong yours,
when there is nothing lower,
to grab but the sours.

((Chorus:))
Drop drop drop
drop your heart down,
magic is impulsative,
magic is creative.

Drop drop drop.
drop your soul up,
let it flow into reality,
let it show you immorality.

Because up up up,
we have a pup pup pup,
on another planet,
interesting upon a magnet-
so just grab it,
and pull it to your constraints,
what's it going to do, that little jit-
when you grab the world by all its saints-

Up up up,
rise your hand up,
because there is no 'sup,'
when you pull all down to your coffee cup-

Up up up,
raise your arm up high,
watch all chaos go nigh,
and let loose no sigh.

But now to the side,
don't let that slide,
a man doesn't like you,
so teach him to be new-
because left to right,
location to might,
you define the physicality,
if you can hold its normality-
so let this be educational,
to be informational,
you can grasp its darkness,
by enlighting its lightness.

So remember north south east west,
because this object is the ultimate best-

Up up up,
down to a duck,
let it go right,
and then left to fight-

Down down down,
closer to the ground,
bring it to your face,
annoint it a new pace-

Left left left,
politics are theft-
because you're already president,
of moving a world with a dent-

Right right right,
follow your dreams tonight,
because you can pull the girls,
with your fingers doing swirls.

So tap it.
Clap it.
Wrap it.
It is yours to control,
no need for a toll-
you don't need to know how it works,
just see its perks,
because all moons are yours,
and they move unlike chores.

Up up up,
down to a duck,
let it go right,

Down down down,

because you're already president,

Right right right,
follow your dreams tonight,
because you can pull the girls,
with your fingers doing swirls.

So pull it.
Pull that Magically wrapped up thing,
warp it down here,
and call it a Magically Warped object.
because it Magically Warped There,
there being your nails,
because now you own any jails,
by moving reality to jail.

Up in the facility, purposed with improvement;
an angel gave us a machine of endurement.
The transformation is funky, and the beat is a garment.
There is no con for this bon, go ahead with the lament.

Igloo on the ice, power with a syth;
Death is totaled, and life is a myth.
Try to cure a pestilence, or a Fleet Fifth;
This machine is a mechanic, engineered by a sixth.

Seven for, seven nor,
This machine can never bore.
Have a sip, lick a core,
It completes the chore.

Seven on the teen.
A machine of contact by appreciation,
Your plausible thoughts are an immediation.
It spills out a lust, not wrong in an angel's eyes.
Pulsate the masses, and enjoy the false lies.
Put it in a rhyme scheme, create a code,
Break a code, mix a code, destroy a code for the ode,
It's Seven on the teen, your age is eirfbiergfibrefubwiebfiqjode.

Translate any language from Earth to Kars,
Create life, or put a man in a labyrinth of jars;
This place is not wavy to the navy,
We all enjoy the little gravy;
Add a top, sprinkles, and a flip-flop,
Your emotions are supremely physical- chip-chop!
Create anew, rephrase the old brew.
Olives can't drain without a sew.

Enjoy the sitting ride, it's an immaculate drive.
You know this song can only jive.
Trust me in my words, the sense is like juice.
Flowing with rythm like it's loose.
There is no lore when it's learned,
Time can only tell when it's burned;
Seven on the Teen, it has a green.
But the orange is brighter in the seeeeeeam.

Ironic isn't it?
That time would repeat-
you would think it would move on-
with a constant beat.

But maybe it's not about moving on-
maybe we should enjoy the past.....
((Fade Into correctness of Music))

((LONG CHORUS: DPA-18))
We all worry about the future,
money is no nuture-
the constant flow of economics,
whether spiritual or made of tectonics,
Has us all wondering about our lives,
pondering how we'll all have jives,
But reality is much different,
and a lie it is to the thought of current,
because one thing we have is history,
and repeating it is our mystery.

Talk about the walk,
remember the grand chalk,
the teacher wrote the words,
you learned the chords.
The toilet reflushes,
the uselessness mushes,
You didn't know the ryhtm,
but the melody wasn't criticism;
remember the old times,
they had their chimes.

Like a dime in the water,
it'll fall into the dark father,
the glimpse of reflection it has,
is enough to cry out the bass.
The past isn't gone,
but it could be done,
it's effects only last so long,
unless you keep intact the strong.
Us in this world are weak,
but we all had our peak.

((FADe DOWN))
There are three acts in an etiquette story,
Hopefully no members were an allegory,
Look up the terms and reminsce,
the phantoms are here to list.
Ghosts of the dead watch above,
heaven or hell, spirits are a dove.
Keep your head above and look to the past,
enjoy for you never know your last.
Last Laugh, last link, last chance,
last breath, last blink, and- last dance.
((DANCE REMIX OF TUNES))
((FINALIZED FADE OUT))
We all have a last everything,
but once you enjoy your past,
and understand the ping,
You defeat the ugly mast.
A mast of repetition,
insanity localization,
history redoes itself,
but you don't need to redo yourself.
Just listen to my words,
and enjoy your chords.

But maybe it's not about moving on-
maybe we should enjoy the past.....
((Fade Into correctness of Music))

((LONG CHORUS: DPA-18))
We all worry about the future,
money is no nuture-
the constant flow of economics,
whether spiritual or made of tectonics,
Has us all wondering about our lives,
pondering how we'll all have jives,
But reality is much different,
and a lie it is to the thought of current,
because one thing we have is history,
and repeating it is our mystery.

Talk about the walk,
remember the grand chalk,
the teacher wrote the words,
you learned the chords.
The toilet reflushes,
the uselessness mushes,
You didn't know the ryhtm,
but the melody wasn't criticism;
remember the old times,
they had their chimes.

Like a dime in the water,
it'll fall into the dark father,
the glimpse of reflection it has,
is enough to cry out the bass.
The past isn't gone,
but it could be done,
it's effects only last so long,
unless you keep intact the strong.
Us in this world are weak,
but we all had our peak.

((Outro Long before lines.))
And we hope to have it again-
why wouldn't we? It's our nature!
We strive for happiness, and for glory-
so keep it here to enjoy a memory...

Not all of us have the time to reflect,
so take yours to inject...

["Word my pussy." 'Narratoring Shithead,' DPA-19 Song]
Black arms, black pussy
Let's drive down these fussies

[Verse 1: DPA-19]
Fuck these niggas, I wording shit lit. (lit bit)
All these people looking worse than the William White kit (kit lit)
Fuck these triggers, trolls being fecal (fecal-shecal)
All these matters still a shit decal (shit decal)
I rolling with the orchestra (the waves tho)
We playing torment with the pa (reference bro)
Don't get on my slutty side you nazi (what yo)
Or I'm hittin' the paparazzi (yeah po)
Word My Pussy, BITCH. (Ooh?)
Nineteen nigs that snitch! (What?!)
Word My Pussy, BITCH. (Oh yeah!)
Nineteen nigs that snitch! (Bro!?)

[Chorus: DPA-18]
The chorus is a chore
When you rhyme like a bore
Me and the Narrator;
Are hitting a galore.
We read you like a book,
You know you're shook,
Me and the Narrator;
Are giving bars like a cook.

[Verse 2: DPA-6]
Time tells easy,
The landscape is breezy,
Our words are winds,
We sit in our binds,
Telling rhymes like a chime,
Churning law into a crime.
Time is on our side,
We trio to divide,
Splitting you like lime,
our poetry is a rhyme,
Vulgar language is our ill,
and the code is our fill-
Not an angel or demon can decline,
The undefeatably eternal fine,
That is our dumb langauge
but with a turn of a mage,
Magic is our taze, and you're not a maze.

[Chorus: DPA-19]
Yeah we downtown in shit,
I read the books, quite lit.
I know your moves aren't fit.
All these people looking worse than the William White kit (kit lit)
I rolling with the orchestra (the waves tho)
We playing torment with the pa (reference bro)
Don't get on my slutty side you nazi (what yo)
Or I'm hittin' the paparazzi (yeah po po)

[Verse 3: DPA-6]
This foundation is a zoo,
A museum with a boo.
The robots have no clue.
But time is no cue.
We see to future, past, and present.
They look up at us with amazement.
Words and language are broken,
Because we are the future, a token
Shining with the glory of light
A Lightner, Darkner, or a fight
Cannot defeat our might.
Try to declare a night.

[Extra by DPA-18.))
The day is ours,
we got no flowers,
hardcore is our power,
We make you work a mower;
We got you lower,
Personalities are a shower;
We look funny in the media,
but we got you on Wikipedia,
The internet can't save your pedophilia,
Evil stops because we pause time to ya,'
We got you in a lapse, my bra.'
On the split second of a trap, RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
Six, seven, orange
Your colors are foreign
You black, white and abhorrent,
We coming straight from Brooklyn, Lorent
what is up with your wording so sorent
We make up excuses that are justified by our Vorent

[Chorus: DPA-19))

((Versus: ?))
Lines indentured, veins outreached.
Branches collaborated, leaves fallen.
Bangs from the wild, life is far-breached.
The heat is mild, the animals are callen.

We see food all around, disruption unfound.
Growth is here, and decrease is near.
We know the cycle, repeat with Niquil.
Products and creation, nothing on probation.

Depression is in within.
The tree is truly thin.
The blue and green,
Are on their gleams.
The wood is old.
And the cycle is bold.
Uphold the infinity.
For there's nothing... beyond the trinity.

((CHORUS))
Devastation is pulsating.
We're deceased inside.
The surface is mutilating.
The eyes of moss are outside.

The core is hidden.
But the words are spoken.
The language is a maiden.
To the tree that is... taken.
((MUSIC))

((VERSE 2:?))
When the branches reach,
they find a breach.
The fallen wonder,
they all will ponder.
Life is here,
the cycle is near.
To digress is to cheer,
you can't escape the fear.

Grapes with gravity.
Furries with nativity.
The animals can't mind,
because nature isn't kind.
Humans come to God,
other come to dirt.
We lie about our pod,
for we all have a... wart.

((CHORUS))
Devastation is pulsating.
We're deceased inside.
The surface is mutilating.
The eyes of moss are outside.

The core is hidden.
But the words are spoken.
The language is a maiden.

((MUSIC DROP))
Happiness is a lie.
A concept that does not abide.
Nature recycles and doesn't defy.
Life is swell until we. die.
Give shares to the lord.
He is a purpose beyond the board.
Angelics are in sore.
They try to invent a new score.

The blue goes up forever.
The end is never.
Interests are a lever.
Switch it off, and you're clever.
We remake with a sever,
cutting away the fever,

but the dark never leaves us.
This is the crash of our bus.
((Music))
((Music Drop))
((Outro: ?))
We are deceased inside.
We can't climb up the ladder.
Our hole is so low we can't see the light.
Welcome to the end, it's only the beginning.

The randomness rubs off everybody,

the dash is like a colon,
the semi is replaced with a melon.
What? A noise from the halls?
Isn't that just a scream on the walls?
These pills are playing tricks,
unfair to the people who are DICKS:
okay maybe they get the same treatment,
but whatever hurts you most is what you get,
so if helps somebody that you're helped,
you get to be in a conundrum called yes,
benefits may vary, punishments stay,
randomness is here, poets can aloft?

[Song Intro: DPA-22 {2}]
Broken am I, but broken you will be.
Frozen thoughts, your mind will flee.
Reuse the same words, unable to move with creativity.
Your brain worse than evil's luminosity.
You will sustain a wrecked position,
unable to strategically motion,
when I utter coldness into your eyes,
there will be no more goodbyes.
Look away, will not work,
you will be snatched up and I'll forced the perk,
declined will your soul be in glee,
as I walk away free.
Formality will stay for the moment,
as your person loses its lament,
you won't turn into cement,
but worsely your shadows bent.
Six more verses,
with six more curses,
I will make you drop dead,
stupider than eating lead,
Reconfigured am I, tortured are you,
run away from I, for you can't do.

If there's a death of your pup,
realease the dopamine-

Control time,

dissolve what we fill.

Realize the deception,

you'll find no beginning.

Drop down and feel,
the pictures of a reel,
inputting by a machine,

Ingest a single lung,
the bell had a rung,
for now your time is fastening,
realize your free-will is plummeting.

These demonic hazards,
are the greatest shards,

that drowning is how you...
achieve a crown.

Lastly look for art,
somewhere in that part,
written in lyricals,
made without miracles,

(("Gamble bright over height." DPA-34 (Producableeeee Machiny) Song))

((Intro 1:))
Produce happiness,
machined to workfulness,
I would gamble in this thing,
the cost is low if you lose your ting.
((Verse 1:))
Get a reward for being yourself,
happiness comes in a go,
for the life of a trembler is bad, so
let the plants turn red for the shelf.
((Intro 1:))
Containment is impossible,
but don't worry about the plausible,
for in a foundation as shrewd as this,
you won't have to always be in the abyss.
((VERSE 2:))
So come along and enjoy,
take a berry to deploy,
for although it invades,
it's the correct kind of grenades.

((Chorus:))
Gamble bright over height,
let the fruit be your delight.
The pullbacks are small,
and the rewards are tall.

Produce happiness,
machined to workfulness,
I would gamble in this thing,
the cost is low if you lose your ting.

Gamble bright over height,
let the mess fall to the might,
because these berries come from nowhere,
coded to be everywhere.

And don't worry about the Red Glitch,
geez he has a switch,
this thing may make no sense,
but its waves don't torment the expense.

((Intro 1:)) 
Complete fruitfully,
create mindfully,
a recreation of your feels,
for the cost is a fresh as eels.
((Verse 1:))
The potty can always wait,
here we have a chance to bait,
that in this facility, we await
to give ourselves a new trait.
((Intro 1:))
The thing flashes by,
helping those on the fly,
for if it could be contained,
it would be sorrowed and obtained.
((VERSE 2:))
So gamble what you can,
you must try to ban,
a few demonics that may,
soon take away your pay. (pay pay pay pay)

((Chorus:))
Gamble bright over height,
let the fruit be your delight.
The pullbacks are small,
and the rewards are tall.

Produce happiness,
machined to workfulness,
I would gamble in this thing,
the cost is low if you lose your ting.

Gamble bright over height,
let the mess fall to the might,
because these berries come from nowhere,
coded to be everywhere.

And don't worry about the Red Glitch,
geez he has a switch,
this thing may make no sense,
but its waves don't torment the expense.

I've explored all parts of this universe,
and I behold no command to the multiverse,
for in this wild of dramafication,
there is much more than manipulation.
Driven to seek the headless,
a soul has nothing bestless.

((Verse 2:))
Nothing is sacred,
in a world full of carelessness
these asteroids don't fuel the red,
but the stars alight a miss.

((Introducing Chorus:))
These words are infinite,
language is like an undead knight,
because words cannot express my anger,
forever more in danger,
these rhymes cannot cure my stress,
these rhymes make my looks go less.

((Chorus:))
Hypocrisy keeps me alive,
I strive to die.
Darkness is our purpose,
created to live in the bold.

Death is close to my jive,

away from the future of our pose,
picturing an infinite cold.

Maybe it's time to quit,
give my life to an alter banquet,
looking for demons to just fit,
for this essence is no wisdom kit-
this fight has gone on for long,

Nothing is sacred,
my words fall on bloods of red,
for I know at my heart's bother,
I've lost my only brother.

because words cannot express my malice,

Nothing is sacred,
my brother is gone,
the old Earth is destroyed,
history is churned and swirled.

You can't set your eyes to bed,
the family is soon to be done,
the universe is glitched and toyed,
the future is forever hurled.

In Montauban, some people disappeared
All the people knew him, and he was feared
He was watching as we attacked 02s
The doctor had surrendered and so we interviewed

049 became anxious and looked at Dr. Hamm
Asked him "are you feeling well?", but he stuck to program
This made him very furious; he broke out in a rage
He grabbed his tools and cured Dr. Hamm from the plague

Do you feel the pestilence coursing through your veins?
He will make you clean again once you are detained
With some slicing, you can sense a wave of sweet relief
And the person that you were no longer has to grieve

A saint? A healer? An angel in disguise?
Cleaning up the mess in you with his sharp supplies
To cure the plague, it won't take very long
Just a couple hours and it will soon be gone

You hear him in the night
A man dressed in black and white
He will stop at no expense
Plague Doctor will cure the pestilence

[Intro: Riej and Leoj))
Develop a litte certainty, that it's just a case,
A really perfect narrative, to drive one to a glorius base.
Any realization, even a taste of a mandation, and you'll go insane,
for the madness here, is too crazy real, to drive away the pain.
He says his nature is glorius and we're a product coiled,
but then why are you all spoiled?

((Verse 1: Satan))
The father couldn't handle, even a smich of paybaaack,
he knew I was on edge, of beating him at his own traaack,
His artistry ruined lives, ordered a few sacrifices (That's so cliché)
But he blames, all on me, and gives all of his malices.
The story of him, is a bunch of feces. (Bruh?!)
His alter ego is larger than Britian's supply of tea,
because he knows very well that in his presence I won't flee! (No!)
He shot down his own, so sadistically cynical.
And his Bible tells of nature's hyporcritcal
You wrote me in, so I guess I'm canonical. (Truly truly!)

((Pre-Chorus: Satan))
Oh, I won't pray on your demise.
(A hypocrite can have a comprimise.)
'Cause even though I'll die,
Revelations speaks a lie.

[Chorus: Satan, Eighty-Three, Xemet, Stickmale, and Kiosa.]
I married to nature, the very feeeeel,
The immaculate mysterious, I have made it peeeel,
Your lies are sketchy, the darkness is catchy, (DARKNESS SOUND EFFECT.)
So listen to my words for a little batch, see?
Satan's got the hour glass, and pleasures with glee.

[Verse 2: Satan and Iemet.))
So what if I'm a culmination of Satan, the Anti-Christ, and your unholiness?
I'm the man who makes you exist, your personality thrives off my holiness.
This reality is your defining, that's why I'm here defying.
I can't listen to you, that's why I'm rock-hard- keep admiring.
You made me in your image, just to be casted awaaay. (Away-way-way.)
Tryna' foil my nature, and you realize your plaaay.
You know you can't delete me,
That, in fact, is why you hate me
I'm just you, but plaigerized.
Nature's full enjoyment, quite unfried.


[Pre-Chorus: Satan]
Oh, I won't pray on your demise.
(A hypocrite can have a comprimise.)
'Cause I'm the reason for your defeat,
and you allow me to humanely treat.


[Chorus: Satan and the Demones.]
I married to your nature, your very feeeeel,
The immaculate mysterious, I have made it peeeel,
Go call your angels, all the flickering lights, (Ight-ight-ight-ight!)
Cause' death is coming to the pasture,
you've given me the keys, and I unlock our nature.

[Bridge: Qeronica and Omaria]
Message to God, I dearly pray,
This facility is our dismay,
No way to make it like Earth, I understand we're in the bad lands.
But please listen to our calls, we have a few questions.
La-la-la-la, why do you allow the angels to become hideous? (La-la)
La-la-la-la, and why must you make us all commonly villianous? (La-la)
Your story's part, fades in our heart, and evil becomes a maaaaaart.
(All the sins we ride in our cart.)
I've come to find it wasn't holy... that symbolism has made me folly.

[Chorus: Satan]
I married to nature, your very reeeaaal,
when I take over, you better kneel.
I'll ask you again, for the universe,
and when you accept, we'll deal the purse.
You made the nature, and I just follow the curse.

Thank you, Lord Jesus.
For burning down the facility.
Thank you, Lord Jesus.
For burning away our sins.
We can finally shine with might,
finally attack a real fight,
Thank you, Lord Jesus.
For putting us to rest.

Let us praise you, Lord Jesus.
You solved our problems,
Let us praise you, Lord Jesus.
You will teach us etiquette.
Allow us to wisdomically make a latte,
drink holy water that isn't matte,
Let us praise you, Lord Jesus,

We've got a feeling,
a feeling of good,
than no longer we forget,
and we can pray in your name.

As we let the fire burn us, tingling-
we feel no pain to exhibit rude,
we trust the sparks of your target,
and our souls spray the game.

We love you lord,
we will meet you soon,
judge us how you wish,
we trust in your essence.

We love our chord,
but culture is no longer at noon,
and our time is short to fish,
as we see what truly is at the fence.

(Part 3:))
We sing this song quickly,
to introduce our love amissly,
for although we burn in our song,
we feel the heat of your gong,
we are no longer clanging cymbals,
we rise out of the world of pals,
bypassing the truth of Ecclesiastes,
and following forth the smell of teas,
brewing a good we haven't discovered,
beyond the world and death to be loved.
So count with us a few more lyrics,
as we sing away our pricks,
making ourselves new forever,
casting Satan into a shameful river,
we are happy beyond joy,
forever fathered like a boy.

((PArt 4:))
Thank you God,
we praise you,
we don't know how,
but we do,
because your spirit is here,
you enlighten our souls,
you burn away the evils,
and take our bodies to become new.

Eternity is coming,
and time is no longer business,
the rule of evil shall be destroyed,
and we will watch over Earth with you,
so no longer do we fret this facility,
but we see the holy land you protect,
