Remember Baldi's Basics? Everybody has mixed opinions- some say it sucks because it took mascot horror to its greatest popular low with its wannabe-retro style, whilst others said it completed its purpose of being a parody of mascot horror. Baldis Basics was genius for its existence behind the low poly reality of its game style, and so is... Preston's Hourglass.
Now, Preston's Hourglass was made for different reasons. Instead of being in a meta-competition about making meta-games, Preston's Hourglass was made by Dreadful Studios and seemingly was a natural Roblox-level-like horror game- something to either grab a quick buck, attention, or a project to release in order to gain some inciteful criticism. Naturally though, there was a touch that maybe they did not intend yet still made Preston's hourglass pop off in a different way other than Banban or Baldis. You see, it's not a meta game about mascot horror, or a contineous joke of random shenanigans like Banban; one of the biggest factors that makes this game good is that its a parody of children mascots in a certain way.
In order to understand the main point- let's discuss why all of the obvious cons and interesting pros make this low-effort game a high-mental masterpiece.
________________
CONS
-The game's framerate and such. The compilement of this game sucks, and we all can see it, hear it, and blah blah blah. But, I think this con can also be visely to a pro on design- you see, such a game with bad game-making structure calls back to the comedicalizing of children's mascot horror. Preston's Hourglass is a joke on playment- because now the kids or whoever can't play the game the greatest, unlike other cheap horror games that are quick and smooth yet without a story- and still Preston's Hourglass still sucks in lore and stuff, but also gameplay-wise, proving that it either sucks as a whole in perception, or each of its factors play a key role into making fun of today's bad landscape.
-The lore and objectives. They're literally Slenderman and The Prestonian Press-tons of Press-toning Matters. Literally cannot wait for a sequel to do the exact same thing. But it is funny that Preston again uses its cheapness to its perceptive use or disuse. Again, lazy thinking, or again a slap on the face to current-day horrors that Slenderman had done it right, and the new puzzles, maps, and enviroments of such games as Poppy Playtime, BanBan, and even FNAF make no fucking sense anymore and are there to be as contrived as the puzzle we try to solve in Preston's Hourglass- an anti-preston spell spelling out his name- a joke in itself, permitting the horrors of wasting your time to prove something you could've predicted from mostly the start, along with other games. The casual love interest infecting the villian with rage is also a stereotypical jab, and the scientific notes without much care to explanation further improve the laziness in game but also symbolize the unexplainabilitized slouchiness of other spiteful lore games like Poppy's Playtime and FNAF.
-The advertising absolutely sucks. I have not known about this game other than certain rap battles- otherwise beatiful Preston would be a faraway dream in paradise. Their con though for advertising, as I guess they wanted to market and compete- if not this isn't a con but a pro overall- but their advertising shows Preston with fingers instead of mitten-hands, and I'd like to say again that is a take on common media overall. In Endgame's trailer, in BATIM trailers, and even channel trailers- people have information that is hidden, or sneak-peeked, or changed in the final product- like Poppy Playtime, we've been waiting to see more of the hand but instead got a giant purple cat, and in Endgame Thanos had more stones than in the trailer- and here this slight change resonates that all medias need to stop the misinformation and abhorrent mysteriousness just to throw viewers off. They don't qualitize their continuations, and that is what Preston here avails towards- a symbolic portrait of a thumbnail depicting wrongful incitement to show that children are most visualized to interpret things incorrectly, uncare about memories, and show forth to forgetfulness and lies they think are true. Truly, Preston's symbolism shows off subconsciously to all who visit for even just a recording of media, especially since horror games delusionally keep things jumbled in logic and that affects the nature of their success and confidence in care from the audience too.

-No sprint. That is a downfall but may be an uprising. The fact that Preston's Hourglass has no sprint creates fury amongst those who are natural to it in a horror game- but truly who goes anymore without sprinting as much as they can? Preston's Hourglass shows that it's not always good to have a sprint, and especially in this game, it understands itself to the point that it helps make the hourglass a fundamental part of its gameplay and henceforth. This also on the opposite side shows how developers in other game making medias can leave out such controls- for as we know, crouching is a common one, but what about jumping- for Baldi's doesn't have that- what about lifting objects, or punching beings, or taking items and using them for weapons? Preston's Hourglass is a simple game because it has to be- if it were anything more, it's logic would have to thrust out its purpose to be more inciting for the moment, but not long-lasting for the thought. There are tables and papers, but those do not match the size of Preston plausibly, and his essence through bare halls is only a say to his simplicity misguiding your conducts of mind to thinking he's a loseristic game- no, the bareness, the simplicity is part of an ultimate plan to symbolize the basicness of all games when we all stand back from its gorey or mystery outputs- horror games are naturally just running down some halls and finding puzzles. Preston's Hourglass outright calls this out indirectly with its enviroment being displayed badly, and its no sprint option- it is a game where you move, where a lore is hidden so intrusively its unreadable, where there is one character you are caring about no matter what else, where objects cannot save you, and most importantly, you cannot sprint away from its madness. Preston's Hourglass shows that only the gimick in games save yourself- that stamina is truly useless against monsters in situations, and that most games should be outputting a logical taste to the objects around; like big objects uncarriable against seemingly weak enemies- but likewise in Bendy, why didn't the protagonist use the axe more- or the FNAF security guard quit? Preston's Hourglass has you stuck, without resources, and without stamina, so that your gimmick of an hourglass is used to its upmost ability, and that it doesn't have to remove factors of it being a parody-comedy.

-He's 2D. This is a con in a 3D game to most, but I see it a little different. His two-dimensionalness resembles him as a character, a self-defying factor of his existence in the game, but in posters he's 3D- for the prompt is that most indie horror games have two-dimensional stories now, where characters are not fleshed out other than their mascotiness, but the imagination- the trailers and posters- give so much potential to the character, that is why he representing to be 3D, but in the game he has the 2D aesthetic because Preston knows what he is- a parody like Baldi's Basics- and his lore, his characterization, is as much as he cares for it to be outputted- but in his art elsewhere, he understands his resemblence, and cares to showcase the possibilities of his endeavoring appearance and that children's mascot horror survives not off what's in the game, but rather what we imagine in our minds theoretically. Preston thrives this symbolism like a businessman, putting less work into what would make him look good and more into what matters- what Preston means. Preston means to show that many characters, no matter how good or scary they look, are just surface-level businessified-characters that are cheap and uncostly to produce a reaction, but he understands that the creative mind is where true passion and horror thrives best, especially personally, and so he only emits himself to his true form elsewhere and not in the game.

-The Ending is horrible, a wall of text, a bad end- but it does further my arguement that Preston is a genius; for he has amassed this to show the basicness of most endings in most horror games, especially those that deem to kids- for what are they truly but a cutscene, a wall of text, and ending of sound; another mystery, another escape; another bland ending that ultimately means nothing. There is no reward, there is no care, there is not good enough lore- you don't even know if the series will continue till the main villian is truly obliterated- Preston's Hourglass shows that these cliff-hangers, these lazy outros are disgustingly pathetic and basically... a wall of text. A wall of communication to tell the reader a possibility, and not a reward, a dopamine-inducing frame, but not a long-lasting prize. Preston's Hourglass doesn't waste its time with a story it tries to make you care about, it shows you what all else is for kid's media if we don't introduce true art and prizes after the long maze- a bland, repetitive, unappreciatable ending to something quickly made for some cheapness. 

NOW THE PROS
-Preston's design. It's that of his personality that mixes so well- the smug chin, rick-and-morty eyes, the eyebrows and hat, the cape of pride, his yellowish-orangish body of extrovertism and hazarding conditioning- its a standout, a true mascot, but a backwards one that fits the ideal of this game being a genius behind the altercations. He's a mascot of reversing children's horror mascots, he's a reference to adult cartoonish characters as well as not being creepy at all- his chase and voicelines perfectly mix together that this is just some random madman being with a certain characteristic to make him stand out slightly from everything else in the competition as we'll call it- no kid could really be afraid of this, yet he is the main of a game that injects a wannabe-horror. Preston works because he is a parody of himself, and it plays off so well when you imagine him in your head, and not on the original template of a game- he's only good as an idea, yet put into a game that utilizes him in a reversing way. Also, children's imagination goes far to make things like Jumbo Josh more characterized and horrific, in which with Preston we imagine him being more of himself working off what we got, which is where the gaps can be filled in and enterprize him as a joke character to fulfill his greatness. Along with many of his lines such as 'I'll drown you in a sea of punches' and "I'll Fuck you up" really instates the affliction of personality traits he may have even when targeting and harassing, which further enlightens the image of his comedic presence throughout the meta-concuction of ideas that may flow through your head. His name is also Preston Ramirez, a notation of P.R. or P.R. Team slash person. A P.R. Team or person is someone who advertises or does public relations well, and again a good ironic jab at Preston as a character, but also a keen visual that Preston is a warning, a public relation trying to invoke the thought of impending doom for children's horror entertainment by doing his job- which is to be ironic yet genius. Plus, Preston's want for his hourglass is so pridefully and centerly placed that it can resemble one of the downfalls of many horror characters- a simple trait. Characters whether horrifying or not shouldn't be so 2D as Preston shows himself in-game to be, such as chasing an hourglass because he was a scientist and loves it- no, there should be more to keep a character interesting and rememberable, and once again this shows Preston knows what he is and shows us the wrong as he provides a imaginative insight to what makes horror characters specialized towards kids unremarkable- they're simple and unintriguing. Huggy Wuggy is known for being a big blue monster, but that's really all- Catnap is known for being a purple cat with some red mist and some story, but again its a simple design and output- Baldi is simply a rage-induced math teacher, and Bendy is simply a cartoon demon- like Preston is an hourglass-chaser- there should be more reasoning behind his personality, behind his greatness, behind his entertainment and existence- but he shows that people boil it down to disrespectful lore that ultimately antagonizes the character's wellbeing as a fictional being- lore on notes or trailers to explain the behavior instead of enviromental or voicing considerance, basic wants or redone actions that cause mass consequences for plot gains, and much more else that can come to your imagination- which is what Preston's Hourglass wants you to actually spend time on- can show you that Preston's design is meant to show the flaws of other mascots, whilst opening up the needed changes through reverse-symbolism to show how we can improve our meta for all horror alike.

--IT'S a MAZE! Another maze, a basic maze, meant to represent that each hall is like a mascot horror game at its most basic- repetitive like the last, bland and bare when you get down to the fundamentals, and sometimes there's a room with a memorable remote, but nothing is worth while like Slenderman was back in the day, and that is what Preston's Hourglass pushes- for a care for the past and simple, not the overdramatic, over-qualitized and over-hyped loserpieces- Preston's Hourglass understands itself and its friends in horror- a repeating mess, a joke, a funny parody of what should be, but isn't- an imaginative darkness further and further as we forget what was behind or run in circles till we either quit or find a new way. Preston's Hourglass is warning us to stop the madness of locking ourselves in a maze full of notes here and there; finding more and more only to never find enough and be constantly chased by the death of our happiness or depression; as I said, the end is a wall of text- a resemblence of what most children's horror games are, and the only way to truly escape is to quit the game- the game the maze is in is children's horror- for horror isn't supposed to be for children, then it's not scary, it's not passionate by the businessifications of companies trying to output something so-called apropiate- Preston warns us that horror is made for all, to be striking and even decensitizing, and children's horror is so not terrifying, that he resembles it through the fact we all run around in a maze trying to make it scary, feeling like we touch on it here and there, but in the end- we need to make horror for all, not subcultures dedicated to make horror a loseristic genre for kids to consume like its a fucking playdoh commerical. The true exit is the quit on the main menu, which itself is a great design because truly what must you do in Preston's Hourglass? Play the game and try to get kids to suck up to your shitty mascots like Banbaleena, or quit and play a proper one that puts us all at a freight we need? Or you could just hit the settings and change your perception- but that's a theory for another day- A PRESTON THEORY! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!

-The hourglass. It is intriguing in existence. Mascot Horror was started by FNAF, and set the characters of mischief center of the stage, literally, unlike past games where it was unknown what was going to chase or occur. The hourglass is amazing as its design and use is that to portray of Mascot Horror- pausing time to let us visualize and take a moment to truly observe Preston, the mascot. The hourglass also has an unknown size and amount of sand, so logically it can be portrayed to work within your imagination and can make sense. It's also a trope I really like, because Preston is in an areal setting where he stands out as a character already- differentiating from the danted grey walls, and tealish bricks below- he's a yellowish, familiar to Rick-and-Morty looking knock off character that his essence being a faster runner than you or someone you see when you hide isn't as fun as getting to stop time and truly eye down his funny appearance right then and there. The hourglass is designed in this space to allow for good observation of the mascot as well as play into the comedic timings and voicelines of Preston as he chases you, yet also is stopped to show that Mascot Horror when paused isn't horror- it's a goofy character chasing you because why not, and the Rick-And-Morty-like design only furthers the greatness that this game was made as a parody of children's mascots particularly, because Rick and Morty is not a natural kids show, and he totally fits in with having the personality of calling all other characters shitty. Another reason for this being the pro is the use- Preston's hourglass permits itself very quickly in regeneration and loss- so the use of safety goes up drastically whence in tough conditions, truly formatting that the horror of a game can be stopped by the simple experimentation and risk of speedrunning or goofing around- yet again another wave of punches at the current day of Bendy and Hello Neighbor, who have lockers and such which act as safe places yet are specifically retarded and silly when you realize the Neighbor could just peer through or Bendy could sludge through all solids- yet in Preston's hourglass it not only indirectly speaks upon this practice in many subjective ways, but also perfects it by logically outputting it via the hourglass- for stopping time truly stops Preston, and could stop other characters- whilst lockers, crawl spaces, and other shit could stop perfectly-capable monsters from getting to you, which is stupid in the end. Sadly, Preston cannot crawl though, which both hurts the game but also helps us realize Preston is symbolic of dumbness yet smartly designed in other factors against it.

-The automatic crouch mechanic shows the disneed for more buttons to rely on. Who needs to press 'C' or 'Ctrl' to crouch when you can walk up to a certain place and automatically do it? Although yes I understand that it would be nicer to have the free will to crouch whenever you please, What this shows is that Preston's Hourglass understands both sides of arguementive controls- that Preston's Hourglass is designed to show you how game should offer a good tutorial instead of blatantly pushing you to it. The missing controls menu pushes you to disregard the game, and that is take on all games- because there are controls that should be there when there aren't- such as picking up or hiding behind certain items such as beds and stuff you normally don't see in low-poly games, yet Preston's Hourglass just straight up removes it because it's made to symbolize that there is a lot missing with the potential of realistic games in all media, and children's horror mascotism is simple at the basics; because it also understands the other side where a game should be simple to hop in and play and all these extra goof-arounds make it a puzzle of a puzzle which makes it unfun and sturdily time-wasteful, unlike Preston's Hourglass which ironically understands your time and puts you into the correct positional arenas where you can get the most symbolism out of the least gameplay.
________________

And that is a help towards the main point. Preston's Hourglass is a parody of children's mascot horrors with some opposites to deride suspicion. Cleverly the lore of the game is its meta symbolism, not its output of input of research or characters. Preston's Hourglass is named after its two biggest greatnesses in this view- Preston being the ideal creature of a play on children's horror mascots and even media as a whole, whilst his hourglass resembles the horror in wasting our time.

Conclusion: Preston's Hourglass is a parody-reverse on children's horror mascots, implementing a simple yet imaginative character that geniusly advises the wrong thing of horror mascots for children and all around so you can wonder about the right kind of terrific possibilites in all kinds of stories. Preston is the personfication of the nature of parodizing children's mascot horror in a comedically-semi-reversed way. As a proud Prestonian, I give this game a Prestonhead/10.
