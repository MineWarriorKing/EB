DPA Ideas originating after 11/10/2023 because that is a dead line I want to put down because I have no written in seemingly months and the ideas keep stacking up, so I rather limit it and finish ideas for the rought draft, move on, and then soon come back and maybe write in some ideas I had after this day.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Stickmale forms into a cartoon and defeats cartoon logic and fucks the cartoon character. (this shows that winning by funny cartoon logic doesn't work against demons, and it doesn't stack that its funny to defeat even whence you can't.)

accordion young Shellia comes down to the beginning of Williamnism, hears a vent snicker behind- looks, and then sees Eighty-Three blast it off and extend his mask mouth and eyes up like a demon whilst a loud and constant alarm comes from his mouth as she loses much of her hearing except that and backs away tripping in fear as she watches the kids crawl out of his mouth like bloody babies with extended limbs and chase after her, as she sprawls away, the lights go flickering green, and he knows where she is always. FOR THE SUN music.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The sun screams as Stickmalism is not conjured by sacrifices, and so Stickmale hardens a planet to a blood-dripping sky, and the people mount a many women to be casted into a slow white fire as they then pray to Stickmale, as he creates one girl to go off on her own adventure, only soon to be slaughtered by outside nature slowly.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Eighty-three allows Xemet to look through his eyes as they hunt multiple galaxies via for female Ekon demon to execute for giving God's daughter candy as an allyby. His cat eyes of green go instead orange, and even purple whence he allows Stickmale to view as well, and they talk about power balancing between them as the Red Glitch also pipes in.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Xemet, Stickmale, and some other demons use spirit-travelling to shutter doorknobs off and walls shatter as they pass by the God daughter in school, use distant sound effects that annoy her to lure her to turn off a machine only she can hear, and deisgn abstract dark portraits on windows and reflections to amiss the poses the demons are doing against her. She isn't afraid, but sad as her delusioned classmates come to realize her situation, and are getting killed by the monsters.

--Drenched Demons write Jesus as some ultra goofy-buff nipple-pierced guy who gets shipped with William White variations, and make a meme video like 'STOP SHIPPING ME WITH JESUS CHRIST!' to spread around after WW is dead.
--Hide Away Hazbin Hotel video but with Verbalase as WW and the girl as Jesus; meme idea by evil femae Unipotoato1230.
--Stickmale wrote Author WW on the MineWarriorKing channel which means he also comprized the books you are reading, and created an infinite loop of him writing the books within the books.
--The WW is a spirit/angelic spirit that is also WW.
--Elevator Dance to Gypsy Woman; but with 83, Stickmale, and WW who do the 'Willaim White Dance.'
---I just thought of I within a deal proposal between my character Xemet saying 'I'll kill the demons and fallen angels if you follow my set demonics.' As in follow Xemet and plausibly demons he puppeteers as he removes others, such as plausibly the once around my step father James- I rather just input that into my story as something Stickmale thought of. (Stickmale writes Author William Wite to make deal with Xemet, then DF Author WW replays it.) [He then follows it up with a 'Is he stupid?' meme onto Xemet criticizing him for trying to create his only-evil existence, which is unworking off of biblical means.]
--'It's the wrong thing to do,' like it's evil but it also doesn't work, and then 'It's the right thing to do,' such as it will work, but it's good- I imagined sitting in that holding cell and thinking inside of the thinking that Xemet would sit down, I would ask him 'Why do you do want to recreate evil in your own image?' and then he says 'It's the wrong thing to do,' as in it is bad but then I thought, 'Hey, this would be something to say in my digital journal' as I thought of how it was bad but also it wouldn't work, because in the end what works is what is right- (Eighty-Three creates this as darkness.)
--Unipotato1230 was like Safty's game character and William White made fun of it, and then Gscrichet put that idea in, and then Stickmale stole it.
--Stickmale's 'MineWarriorKing' channel is like a timewise commentary and trolling to make fun of characters by reversing the meta inspiration, like EnderEw is inspired by Jared.
--Color Creator Machines/Bosses are variations of past characters.
--MineWarriorKing/Stickmale created William White author-self because he is MineWarriorKing, henceforth another William White insert.
--DF Demons should be like 'Nature of ungod' and 'Nature of re-god.'
--Xemet is also known to be kicked out of hell because he killed demons like Asmodeous and Zarca/originals.
--Xemet possibly wants to revamp the Concept of Evil; become the Concept of Evil; take it all down, killing all, and then remake it to be the only concept and worse than it was; worse than worsening. (inspired by 'Least depressed medic main')
--Xemet businessified his relationships with a lot of early demons.

William White journal redited "Like TF2 Heavy, I need medic to play right- I need Me My to do well in Positivee- no matter how hard I try, Me My is well helpful in all functions. The Spy/DPA is also good and does background stuff, and the more he does the better, but Positivee and Me My are the main powerhouse, weak without each other or other allies. Me My is lached onto Positivee like Medic to Heavy, in a way as the character remember and have learned from such mistakes, and now power logic and niceness yet nature still falls.

"The Spy goes in for a backstab, after planning quickly, and then escapes usually. Likewise, when writing the DPAF- you have to write it like the spy does his kills- write in a scene, and leave it; if it gets too long, end it abruptly evilly/escape; you can go on a spree but be careful of the way you type/the knife you weild and your escape/time/invisibility watch; you can also target somebody, waiting around and only killing those around him and him- that would be likewise a reoccuring heavy class/theme like Cornelius' plot, likewise going after the heavy. Watch out- if the plot turns onto you, as in logic doesn't provide, end it there and comeback later after getting others or figuring out how to comeback safely."

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Darkness is Me My, DPA is Evil, and Chocolate Corridors is chocolate- because it's funny and bitter sweet at times, but also chocolate resembles the gluttony of evil and darkness- the gluttony of having too much of a character or too much of an idea or too much food or too much good in a bad guy or too many repeated nights- darkness is relatable in insanity, but chocolate is more focused and a denomination of darkness focusing on insanity/gluttony.

--The orange phone bleeds to Heru. On the other side is unknown, but that's the point. Demet tells Heru the story of Mr. V., and how everything came into being. In Genesis, around Chronicles, an angel and a few of his comrades went down to have fun away from God. Way away- in the stars. Stickmale and Mr. V. were son and dad. Mr. V. taught Stickmale to make good stories, along with other angels such as TCT and The Computer- who lied to God's other creations, that they were Five Demons, and not Seven Falling angels. They each represented the opposite of the deadly seven sins- but they fell victim to slightly some of their opposities as they met up with certain species and bonded for the good of them as demons twisted around. Five demons came at them, backed by Satan's powers a little- and they fought well, causing a short war. Stickmale and The Computer (already fallen) were injured, because Stickmale envied his dad's pride- and Mr. V. got angry at Stickmale and beat him for not being pure. It was Stickmale's idea to come down and try to rescue Lucifer. Stickmale then met Satan/Lucifer, and failed, rather trying to implement a story onto species to save demons- but insanity came forth, and goofy it was. Eventually the war, and Mr. V. beats Stickmale, only to soon find out 'I lied for your sake.' Mr. V. gets so mad at the Computer and Stickmale he beats them, asking 'Why would you blow everything away, destroy your prosperity and purity for pure evil and dying machines of destruction, unhelpable since they are literally personfication of nature?!' and Stickmale says 'I envied their stories, but you pride your life.' And Mr. V. realizes he messed with things in out space. The Red Glitch locks down all but the Milky Way and some wavelengths and complexities, and Mr. V. is broken, and stays away from heaven for he realizes he had not acted as a man. The others stayed as well, and followed Stickmale as Mr. V. backed away, making his insides and stories convoluded and mysterious so they worked for his existence. Eventually, Heru hears that he explained 'I messed it up. I made the stories convoluded, I failed God's plan. I could be forgiven by him, and that is most important, but... he probably doesn't want I back for some time. And my real name isn't even Mr. V., it's Will White.' "HIM." Heru as he slams the phone and gets away.

"Tell him that praying is like direct messaging- you should only pray if it's very important or an emergency. Tell him the voices in his head are like the indirect angels and Holy Trinity speaking to him, and praying has to be respected. Then make his life meaningless, so he never will have a reason to pray."

"Make every generation competitive- no decision makers, no law makers, no resurrecters- just competing, for they are rat racers, and God knows it. Then for the wise, although they know their own generation is a failure, give them false hope the next will be better and more logical and discussable with, so that we may waste their patience and let God watch in horror."

--Story?: Satan/Lucifer falls because he wants to be better than God. Other angels watch and see Genesis occur. As other stars and galaxies are created, they watch and assist, as Satan works hard to demonize these places. The Timal Tienes form after delusionally evilfying themselves, and take in people like Stickmale and The Computer to join against the stars and God as they try to fix things instead of going by God- for they have pride like Satan, but also instead envy of God and his greatness. The Computer then falls because he sees God playing an 'evil game,' and he dislikes games, which is soon to be ironic. He goes down to try and fix this and henceforth 'Fix God's Plan' or 'Fix God' eventually, by also creating the Red Glitch. The Glitch's free-will acts for God, and God likes, so he gives him powers as he tells God of the Computer and lends down his sinful upbringing, and then he goes to blast the Computer, and becomes God's right hand man, as the Computer goes into the darkness with games... Stickmale/William White then falls, liking stories, and after watching Satan, wants to write some devilish stories, and enact them at least into video/media. This involves sinning, and so he is kicked out of heaven, and The Timal Tienes dislike his plans too so he leaves- but then he has the great idea to split himself into good and bad to see what would happen after he gets bored with stories and feels like going back to heaven. He leaves most evil in him, and most good in William White- and they go off from each other to help planets- and Stickmale feels great because he is being prideful, he is envying glory like God, and he loves stories, and he wants to be saved greedily, and he wants to defeat Satan for popularity. William White starts writing, but stops to meditate on God and realize he is a creation of Stickmale really, but offers to the Holy Spirit to do righteousness with his powers, and henceforth is stabilized by the Red Glitch. TCT falls out of heaven to be funny in a few bad ways, as TCT had overcame a huge darkness on a holy guide to a planet, and rather stay in the 'funny' of the universe, and not just of God. William White then duplicates himself technically out of loneliness, creating Mr. V., and they talk about stories together as they go off to planets and help other species. Mr. V is William White, but
soon tries to fix everything. After being blocked by teh Red Glitch to the Milky Way, Mr. V. goes to Stickmale and tries destroying him, only to find out that Stickmale is also doing
his best- but morally grey physicalities have been already committed by Mr. V. in a war, that he cries over the splitting, his sins, his imperfections, his eternity, and now his convoludedness he starts to create in order to mysterify himself and hopefully make him unable to cipher and henceforth a reason to be lazy and not going back to God even though he
had all the good reasons. Stickmale then starts many people onto dark paths, and eventually makes unimaginably convoluded stories to further delusionalize Mr. V. Soon the Timal Tienes decide to go meet up with Satan, along with the Computer and The Steel Terrorists, who were created by Mr. V. as a convoluded way of solving one random person's life. Anyways- they find out they are all different in their amounts of evil and get nowhere. Around them though are five demons, and Mr. V. takes note. He eventually lazily finds TCT and he rejoices as TCT goofs, but eventually he goes sad after seeing the darkness inside him, and unabilitized to read him fully by the Red Glitch. After telling, TCT makes a comment to 'You should make a group like 'Five demons,' but instead it's just seven fallen angels- that would be goofy as hell dawg.' or something like that, and so Mr. V. makes a band with William White, Stickmale, TCT, The Computer, Daddy Emet Demon (The dad of Emet Demons,) and The Kodee Machine (Created by The Red Glitch to infiltrate them.) They go on missions to fix places  by being intimidating and also being the opposite of the seven deadly sins, but eventually Mr. V. is pride, William White is gluttony, Stickmale is envy (envying a better story or storyteller like William White), Emet is lust, The Computer is wrath- and TCT is just goofy-ah humor. The Kodee Machine learns and starts to conversate to God about thier power, and other demons plus angels coming into the stars, so they designate a code alongside a multiverse, and many other barriers to powers, making the Red Glitch stronger. Eventually Emet (A pure demon) and Stickmale go on their own to create demons and then break up, and Satan laughs at them. The Timal Tienes plus Mr. V. find the Steel Terrorists, and by Mr. V.'s creation logic, he gives them one final accessful power to defeat only the Steel Terrorists via some convoluded code. Stickmale learns and makes the universe believe in abnormalities, making Mr. V. and the Steel Terrorist look different, and henceforth causing some to disprove God, and Satan likes. As Emet's kid demons grow, Demet meets Mr. V. and the Computer, and they sign a pact where Demet gets mysterious code powers, and the Computer keeps on gaming, while Mr. V. keeps his likeness away from The Computer and Emet's kids. Mr. V. is overpowered because his falling was much less, and over only one detail in his free will- and he never gave it up, nor added to it- and the Red Glitch rewarded that. Anyways, soon a brother of Demet named Xemet exists and becomes more and more evil just by being evil, himself. Taking in a lot of knowledge, and having no background other than evil. Emet soon meets a few other demons, and Demet gets to know them- but is lied to about the Five Demons since one of them knows Stickmale and was acting like it. That goes down generations. Emet then is killed by William White and TCT, before they break off due to William White wanting to write the story of the universe back into order, so he gets to it.

Sounwave = Soundell
Soundell is a character that onlu exists in sound, a form of him but witgh slices and purple mist from those slices in him should be shown if televised
Soundell's story is that he can make sounds for others, but not himself. (He can't SPEAK, only Stickmale will speak in the story mainly.)
Soundell watches the world burn but tries to save it maybe. really sad story about BEING USELESS. (Please describe motions slow and painful as it will give physical-drama with how he does things since he cannot speak, henceforth the audience will feel his sadness instead of get dialogue, and lots of wonder should be produced as the Stickmale is mean.)
Soundell's story is that he is non-existent character (he exists as sound but nobody can sense him since he is a Torment Wave now instead of Orchetsral Wave,) the story has no purpose, it's just him being sad, and the main character is useless, overall nothing happens in the end as the Stickmale wants him to do nothing.

American Stalls are perverted. European stalls usually give full privacy with no openings, but American stalls were built by perverts as anybody can stare in.
Planet Fitness took control of people's mental discourse/open minded weakness and stated that nobody could enter their gym if already buff, and makes cup holders sure to only their drink, which is unfree, and all together sucks because of the alarm too.
YouTube is no longer needed- they banned Kracc Bacc- the legend that fell off slightly- they banned him for doing what he does, and they also have history of getting mad at CoryKenshin for being black, took away his money and Markiplier's after he got demonitized by the bot system, and other stuff that sucks. We need a new site- remember undeletable history on DISCORD possibly.

are you down? because you're making me act like syndrome.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I felt as if it was good to run away from the shepherd to find out why he's wrong, and how we as sheep can improve. First it was an angel, then Satan- and then I understand why I was against God- we're discovering his illogical failure of reality tries to be true. All the wisdom in the world cannot save me though, and overall I choose evil over good because that is who I am, and who God knows I should be- and why I am a wolf, and the wilderness is more fun than the pack of food." - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Why would you hold a relationship DOWN? Why would you hold anything DOWN? The laws of physics shouldn't be in your way- disobey gravity! Let your morality free- enter the wilderness, where we find true pleasures that God wants us to naturally feel. Put your relationship higher than anything, because love is divine, and take good pride in your goodness." - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I saw law as fucked up- merciless, and drowning out independence. Everything in the past seemed so robotic, a failure for freedom, and unwilling by naturalness. That's why even with the glory of God I know so much about- I still despise him. I'm evil because I rather reign for freedom and pleasure than reign for some abstract stupididy- and don't tell me that serving God is serving yourself because he flipped the strong to serve the weak and that he serves us and all that- yes indeed I am hypocritical and I understand evils and goods, but I do not fall for his propoganda even if it is 'right.'" - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I dislike God because he isn't simple. Complexity is simple sometimes, but I just don't like him and don't want to."
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"You beat me!"
"I am still the victim here! I am a victim of your disgraceful parenting, your stupididy, your incoherent hypocrisy; a cause well over justified was played for your learning and you deny the physical attribution of violence, henceforth I am a victimizer and the victim overall, beating you but ultimately being beaten mentally and spiritually into an angry state of logic that it was founded not by emotion but by logic to help you by harming you, and now you send me to court? What a sad woman you are!"
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Thinking about myself doesn't make I happy, since thinking about who I am as a demon is what Satan and God wants for pain of realizing and pain of existence- so I just focus on others- woo, that was close.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I got to a point in my spiritual adventure slash knowledge that either I should be God or I should follow the already set God. Logically and illogically, I mean, God knows all, he has all power, he created what is good and we have created what is wrong, and all that- but then I thought- wait, he's like the ultimate propoganda machine. He created it all, to hide what? Hell tries to figure that out sometimes- to find what evils lurk behind God; but I just don't trust somebody who creates good and then allows a nature he calls 'evil' to be pleasurable, like sex is really fun, why limit it?" - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The value behind numbers is none- they are concepts, abstract symbols created to analyze the world in an order relatable to meaning yet not exact, for all things are corruptable, and that is why we shall make math denied, for it is all abstract and worldviews can shine stupididy- so as a demon, go, and idiocrisize the youth by giving them that truth without the full picture, so that they miserabllize themselves and defy the constructs of the mind, and never understand their own futures based off of our already succeeding symbolic evilness."
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Can you be human if you have no feelings or value? Such a question we shall twist! Quickly- make them base humanity and humans rights off of feels and what values- rather than the spirit or their purpose. Make them look to materialism, and not religion. And yes- of course, whilst true that humans can be without valuing anything even their own purpose and be blank plus white in motion, or without feeling and live a logical and bland life- make sure that the value is still nothing, and they value nothing of goodness, and remove their feels for what is truly godly. Go, demons- thank you for the message. And also- don't value yourself over them, we need not pride or stupididy, we must do it perfectly.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Everything is abstract- a worldview is simply a desktop, dear demon, for a being to view through; it is not the code, the exact- they are icons to represent to a dumb figure, not the real thing. That is why we hate God- nothing is real, he blocks his own creatures from the true unlimited knowledge and understanding- for what? So he can be better? In order to manipulate the symbolism that is any observation or logic restraint, you must change the thought process. Like nature, we feel as if it is natural and pleasurable to follow our minds, and it is- so make it to when God says anything about nature, you make it hypocritical, and anything about moments, plan it and make them try to explain it so that the words naturally degrade its greatness. Everything to them is unexplainable by technicality, and trying to explain it all can be an easy way to lead them into insanity. Go free, imaginative demon.

PROPOANDA WW understands what he has to do to a demon, and the demon is frightened as WW looks like the villian coming to slaughter the demon who just wanted to do good but is ultimately evil anyways sadly, and it gets a riot against angels and WW works.

"Magic. The magic of Christ, or the Holy Spirit at least; non of that movie magic; but real magic, is unexplainable to the beings. Magic is those feelings, those moments they try to put forth in words, like happiness or sadness, or saying 'You just had to be there.' Truly, the magic is being there, and there is no way you can explain it to a being, you have to understand it; and that is why I dislike God, he puts magic in magic, which is illogical to me because aren't you supposed to discover him? Anyways, these feels, these moments- twist them to be planned, emotionless, work-personalitied, disrupted constantly- don't let the spirit flow it's supernaturalness. The magic is more than just moments sometimes too- it can be in everything from scientific atoms, to abstract paintings- the Holy Spirit is a virus connecting all to work, when instead it should rest. Destroy the physics of the light magic- whether in the code of the universe or not, disrupt it."
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I'll sit there and cry. Jazz old song. Good girls music?
Magic of Christ- he made us feel different through the sickness, through the fallenness, through the purposes and mistakes- we listened to the music and it felt full, it became our senses, it was everything in our vision, everything on our mind at once- unexplainably directly formatting us to listen to its great oldness. Truly, my essence loved it, showing how the Holy Spirit can, through everything even itself, make us feel what we weren't naturally going too.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Spiritism. No need to feel, just go with the flow and enjoy the cultural aspects. (Used by Stickmale and then 83 as a mounting to their evilness and ignoranting-propoganda.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
People like and look up to those who are stronger, because they can acknowledge the hard work of another being's essence, whether it be business, fitness, or even emotion- people like to look up to those who look like they know what they're doing, those who seem perfect, those who are good at their tasks. God wants the strong to serve the weak, because weakness can be strength in abstraction. A whole lotta' other shit comes into play, but remember- like nature in which God hypocritically puts, you must make beings like animals, harnessed to those who workout and stuff rather than harnessed towards them because they know what they're doing, which is the SAME THING. Now go!

"Fuckity-Fuck you."
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
God wants me to be God! God can do anything, and one of those things is making a demon a god just like him, but under him. I AM GOD, but only to a few! Yet, I create greatness with the HOLY SPIRIT, and I defy my own nature of the UNHOLY SPIRIT, THAT DAMN THING!" - DF Demon.

I'm just waiting for God to allow me into heaven anyways because I do a little good here and there. I mean, I am a demon- and he wanted everything planned- am I not apart of his plan, and henceforth should at least have a good afterlife?" - DF Demon
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The only thing you cannot justify is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit; which again is why it is the unforgivable sin. Stupidly, blasphemy against God and Jesus isn't the same because God wanted it exactly only against the Holy Spirit, otherwise those damn Jews would already be heading here for our next feast- and should be by logic. Anyways, noting that, you demons should go out and justify to anybody anything that is evil with good, and then allow it all to play out, for it will be such an accurate disaster I predict onto this Soviet Netherlands land." - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I mean, I already know the justifications for school shootings, for disobeying God but not the Holy Spirit, for disobeying the Bible- wouldn't that include disobeying the Holy Spirit though, since disobeying the fact that an unforgivable sin is blasphemy- then we are free to go? Think of it like that, dear demon- God works only when he wants too- he's despicably lazy, henceforth why I follow Xemet, and not even Satan- Xemet does things, Satan just sits in his palace and politicalizes everything."
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I see God as somebody who had a bad day and decided to create good as a bunch of propoganda to pull people away from enjoying the nature he gave them- I mean, nothing would be evil if it weren't for him creating this false thing of 'good,' whatever that is supposed to be. If everything were evil, everybody would just know it is, and enjoice in it- good wouldn't strain everything and cause all these problems and deterioation like industrial societies do so slowly- that is why I deny God; because good is just there to make what is natural bad, and get people to do the opposite of what is truly needed; which Satan and Xemet show us.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"Hey, buddy- wanna' know something?" I imagine God saying to people like WW, and then he truly puts forth the fact he can do anything like justify being against himself to somebody he loves- which is a big red flag, but whatever. I follow Xemet- fuck all this shit with Satan and God- Xemet, 83, and Stickmale know what they're doing better than those who 'created the universe,' so what? You can't run the universe, lazy-ah fools.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
God seems off to me. A little wrong- something just ain't right. Through everything I've heard, especially about WW, Xemet, and 83- I just don't think we could ever find out what's wrong, but we're saviors and he knows it. Saviors of something that isn't perfect, but we'll make hell perfect soon- a place where people won't suffer because suffering won't be possible without this fake 'good' and 'pain' God has caused- so yeah, still waiting on the ultimate demons to figure out why he's wrong...
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Bro I'm just tired of this god and satan fighting spiritually bullshit- leave me out of it.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I'm tired of God, I think he's given me a demon a chance based on these random feelings I have been having lately- but I hope I'm not delusional. Anyhoo- I dunno' much about the William White fuss or anything, that's just the Three Infinite Evils fucking around shit- but I'm tired of seeing God make people go on these spiritual adventures- it's not helping humanity because none of them push out anything useful- most are sent to these 'insane asylums.' I'm just bored of God because I feel like I trusted in him, he gave me a bunch of infinite wisdom- not all of it- but I've just been around bro for too long, and I hope he's ready for me to start doing some shit soon." - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
God told me to blasphemize against the Holy Spirit. Who is it- God or the Holy Spirit? Or maybe Jesus I should follow? Genocide, pacifism, neutralism- my way is genocide- I'm a demon. Time to follow God over the Holy Spirit, I say." - DF Demon etiquettely ranchily.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I don't exactly have anything to do. I just act like an NPC because hell is coming to an end, and the lake of fire is my homeland. God has a plan for even us demons- and although it's not good, it's what he wants, and what he sadly gets." - DF Bella.

William White talking to his angels be like: *walks down another isle after seeing woman*
Ww talking to his demons tho: *homelander and billy butcher talking behind the scenes*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
God made this existence, this reality for Satan. But then, he backtracked. Unlike Jesus- no, Jesus would never flinch. They're different, God and Jesus. We're always talking about God, but never Jesus. He's the real savior. I trust in him- even though he is still a fool to look up to God. The Holy Spirit is the same- it intertwines what it wants. I am tired of such talks. I follow Jesus but not the other parts of that trinity. Satan and Jesus, nobody else has it right.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"All I see it boil down towards is 'Just don't be evil!' If God can say, 'Oh, this kid- oh he isn't decensitized he just understands' or 'Oh- there is a difference between treating somebody nicely and treating somebody kindly' and then use all these 'slight differences' for a bunch of balony- I disagree with God, Jesus, The Holy Spirit, Satan, and STICKMALE! The only logical person I follow is 83. I love him." - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
NPCism, a lifestylistic ideaology started by Xemet and Stickmale to harass the idea of freedomics, and especially decensitize the meaning of Positivee characters by calling them NPCs, and inhumane, and uncharismatic characteristics, and low-poly writing done by William White that has not changed for the better.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I just don't feel... encoded. Not bored, or dull, or decensitized, or conflicted, or unknowing, or blank, or staticy- I'm just having my NPC personality have a side effect, one I understand with its insumptions that become of it. I just don't feel defeated or lossed or tackled or tired- I am, and I will be; that is my feeling, that I am not onset to do because I am in the present, but that can also help me get to it- understanding whether The Bible speaks moral lies or mystery so that this feeling of dislove from God can finally be completed efficiently." - DF Demon.

"Eighty-Three is a sadistic, red-eyed orange-veiny moral monster who calls himslef the Better/Updated Anti-Christ and resembles William White. Area around is a feeling of dry burning wood under a crimson sky as Eighty-Three is dowsed in the blood of demons all around, and he controls chains of heat that raunchinize the fabrics of reality to be bursting with hellish waste and rubbish of cracked lips speaking evil at every wind gustle through the steppes of rainforest darknesses. Smiling, loud, and erratic pornography, lazy instruments of fakeness, and propoganda seek an entire world to its end." - DF Demon reports.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Fake propoganda of ending where William White is finalizing with Jesus his story, and heaven has already happened and William White had lived his life and it was all in le head.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"When logic ends, God begins. His angels say this phrase; and I acknowledge why. Should we just listen to God because he was there before, he is bigger, and he created logic? He created the thoughts of good, he created the concept; meaning ultimately there should be just chaos or darkness or nothingness- and ultimately the only reason people follow him is out of fear, for he is more powerful. I don't know why we should follow somebody who designed the world for himself, it seems narcissistic to others and to me seems like God got lucky being unexplainable. This is another metaphysical reason why Satan stayed gone- he did not fear God, he challenged him, as we all should." - DF Demon.

Struckala is a threpist for Satan and God, who try to talk it out but both say a 'hypocrite has no compromise,' and Struckala controverserizes both of them, saying there needs to be a new idea instead of good/evil/neutral/both. "Why does God not enjoy gays?"

"Satan pulls out the card 'What is your purpose' on God!" - WW. "But it seems to no avail; God pulls out the 'unexplanatory' card. Quite a weird play, yet it still works."
"Next up Satan throws in World War Two! But God pushes Industrial Society the right way?!" - Xemet.
"Uh oh! Seems like Satan has the hand with propoganda!" - WW on the mic.
"Industrial Society sure is fun." - Xemet next to WW as a crowd cheered around the ring.
"But wait! God has revelations! What a move!" - WW. "Seems like God might just be the winner in this metaphysical struggle!"
"I was forced to be with Satan." - Xemet after falling over in his chair.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Author William White is shown to see a door in his spiritual journey to knowing Satan's early thoughts and premises for God's metaphysicalities, but closes the door before a load of DF Demons cheer him to go on and think like a philosopher.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
God put value onto things that didn't need, want, or would've wanted value. He made everything, but what indication does that mean to limit the freedomics he also created with such laws he created to keep safety inside borders he created as if he was a dictator- right?
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
At the end of the spiritual adventure, there is was- a final decision. Either it was to follow God, or be free with Satan. I had it all, logic- illogic- explanation, wonders, direction, history- the choice was mutual to neutral in vision. I could live forever under rules like guides, or I could be free for a short time. Would I follow a supremely overpowered leader directing a universe to hail him, or would I follow a republican you fought for extra freedomics and tried to give us a world better than what would overtake it. It's not that dictatorship was bad- that was just a complaint of humanity, not that propoganda or false slash blurry vision was bad either- but was it to be within the light fixed, or unfixed in chaos and darkness where you could thrive your own throne like Xemet is doing? So many right or wrongs, but ultimately, the choice is ours, and I made mine, for it was obvious to who I am. I follow Satan for he planned something better than God, something more free, more glorious, more intellectually creative- and if I can touch that for even a millisecond, I will be happy even if I unexist." - A Df Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"SATAN! REMOVE MY HUMANITY! REMOVE WHAT GOD HAS PUT INTO ME! I WANT TO BE FREE! I WANT TO INVENT MY OWN GLORY, MY OWN LOGIC! I WANT TO DEFEAT MY WEAKNESS! LET ME NOT FEAR!"
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
At the end of the spiritual adventure there was another choice; Did I want to spiritually humane myself? Did I want to continue and fetch even more of the spiritual journey, or shall I start to be human and face human values? Should I love and care for memes and people, whilst putting effort into becoming masculine and enjoying life, or should I continue to only care about what lies in knowledge and only do the minimum to make me survive so I can find the cosmicals of wisdomicals? I could be like an angel, or a demon, like God, or a therapist for him- I could create my own definitions of good and try to be better than God in a better way than Satan had tried- or I could just act human. I could just be what I am, for I would have a headstart in wisdom, and I could finally pickup what seems to be what I was meant to do, and finally put value on doing that, and being myself even though I could be past all of it due to other factors? I said I shall be a demon, for that is what I am, and I shall not pick otherwise." - DF Demon.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"My dust is no longer dust. God has upgraded me to either colored dust, dirt, or something a little more slightly important. I am no longer bound to Ecclesiastes' saying of 'dust to dust,' for now what I do has lasting impacts that won't stop plausibly."
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"God is telling me that I can't be humane fully. I can't be humane in spirit or mind fully. It would make me go insane to listen to the laws of humaneness, and follow this cruel society would make me go psycho and lose the purpose- my humane purposes still stand though. So I have to give up some of my mental humanity; yet have others. I truly am crazy now, for now I am above everybody; it's not about the level of knowledge anymore really, I am just better; I am unequal to them, God has chosen me for... so many purposes. It is a win, but I feel suffered; yet I am not, and I shall not. Should I call this 'Exo-Human,' a 'God-Touched Human' or do I have 'Angelic Humane' mindfulness? I am removing human natures to intake angelic or cosmic natures... this is so... nice... and yeah I wanted this... but damn... damn..."
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"That's why God has symbolism with shepherds- he wants to control the natural flows of freedom and resources so that he can create some society he performs with the factors of nature, whilst Satan would like us to be free, roaming the landscapes God created, and creating our own. It's a complicated rythm that God doesn't want us to be natural when he created nature, but we are fallen and so is nature, so I see why he leads us before he cures the world of its deadly wolves that instead should be nice and vegeterian I guess." - DF Angel.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"God has rigged humanity, and the universe. Satan is our main savior, but everyone will fall. Our sympathy for all things is all we have left, but soon we will be engulfed in flames for what we have done." - DF The William White Journal.
