Jemet:
"I seethe for justifications."
"I strive for justice, whether cruel or not in punishment."
"God doesn't love you."
"There is no hope for you."
"The lake of fire has opened just for you."
"I may be evil, but I do just good."
"TCT, please screw OFF!!!"
"I have been watching you for a long time, miss."
"You have lived in a bubble of illusion for so long, you forgot your own sins."
"There, in the dark, is where your corspe will soon lay, to be forgotten, yet never concealed."
"All of you, sadly- will return to dust as which you came from. I, unluckily, will return to death of which I was born out of."
"My brothers are merely obstacles in my way- soon this foundation will be revamped to God's liking."
"Remember Gemet, for he tried harder than I to be with the lord- but had no realization of what he was."
"You are nothing without love."
"I am something, for I love justice."
"Your mouth is a clanging cymbal, and I've come to dismantle it."
"I tear the flesh of evil off many sinners- but you are only made out of it only, and will surely die."
"Both God and Satan are going to love what I do to this vermin."
"DPA-7 is fun to manipulate."
"Mm... finally, somebody with a soul."
"Accept death, for it is your salvation."
"You are a demon. Your salvation is in the death I cause you."
"No facility is a safeguard against me, as you will know pain soon enough."
"Absurdism is your treacherous mind's way of trying to find peace in logic."
"I will kill those who operate evil- they are like food to a lion."
"I damn those who disobey to an eternal gulag of flames."
"Welcome to negative-first circle of hell, where I am omnipresent."
"When should we attack, good man?"
"Time will not save you three."
"My wrath only ends at the lord- nobody else."
"Where there is death, there is me, for the death angel respects me currently."
"Let pride make you fall over, for there is too much vanity in you."
"I find is absurd to treat somebody with respect when they never even respect anybody else!"
"You can call my lines retarded all you want, for I don't fret like you will."
"Electricity? Have you no sense against a demon's physicality?"

"I am Jemet, the Justice Demon. I have no offerings with your essence."
"Mm... I smell disruption..."

Xemet:
"This facility bestly is stupider than I initially expected."
"Orange and brown is the color of this foundation, and I splinter white purification all over it." (Xemet laughing as he read the fanfic of Jemet.)
"Hm..."
"At this era, not even Satan's best wrath can save you from mine."
"Yes, bestly so."
"I think it would be best to advise the Blacklistere on this matter."
"Mm- come along, Stickmale. We have better things to do."
"Bestly we shall provide a new scheme to enter their minds. Maybe it can divert onto a random spiritual path, taking them far from their purpose."
"Tell of hell the William White way- but leave out the bad parts."
"If I found William White, bestly we would have a fight- worstly I would leave without a sustaining word."
"Williamnism is remarkable in that it is so easily twistable, yet so influential."
"Spread the propoganda, we have intriguing things to do."
"The guards are amongst the walls with earphones; bestly echo sexual immorality to their randomized playlists."
"Hello DPA-3. Do you have the samples?"
"Hello Blacklistere, have you bestly made Sector Seven-B industrialized entirely yet?"
"Elongate your sentences like you elongate your dick, Phillip." (Xemet laughing as he rapes Phillip.)
"I have no use for the word 'stud.'" - Xemet at a comedy show.
"Ha-HA-HAAA! GET RAPED LOSER! YEAHA!" - Xemet.
"Let Satan protect you, for he would give us all the universe, and God would not."
"There are so many sayings, that I agree you shouldn't quit." - Xemet lied.

Stickmale:
"Cap."
"Where is that monkey-boy Xavier?"
"Heyo Phillip!"
"Hello Droklar!"
"Alrighty, this is getting weird even for me! No- not really, but damn bro..."
"Ayo bro?"
"Where is that sussy boy Qervork?"
"Heyo Phillip!"
"I very much agree with you Xemet- we should definitely produce a movie named 'Fifty shades of Xemet.'"
"Your eyes are so annoying, Kiosa."
"I think it would be silly to kiss all the boys."
"Me-sa' about to stand on you."
"You must equivalently agree that with exquisite taste, I am cute yet realistic."
"Logically speaking, I derive pleasure from seeing characters undergo tough situations and make it out- alive or not- henceforth a point to my sadistic wellbeing."
"Heru- Eighty-Three is in chamber six-A."
"Why are there numbers and symbols for every hall and type of room in this facility?! Does anybody else care or even remember other than me?"
"Uselessness is one of many ways to destroy somebody's time and effort."
"Quiet, mister- my massage is not done."
"Infinite evil? Psst- I think Satan is worse than Xemet."
"Xemet is a fallen demon- Xemet is a fallen demon!" (Stickmale mocking Xemet like a child.)
"I know I am the only being that really pisses Xemet off, and that is one of the reasons why I stay around him."
"Cornelius- I think it is better to leave the casino and enter the strip club- ask me why when the news gets to it."
"Gay sex porn- why are children so into that these days?" (Stickmale slowly looking up to Xemet as Xemet rubbed Stickmale's head.)
"I love gay sex. We should have some."
"I exist as a soul incarnated into a physical aurora of goofiness and sadistic naturalism of story-wealth, and henceforth here I essence myself ultimately."
"OoooOOOOOoooooooh- the spooky scary penises are haunting you!"
"Just remember Omaria- history repeats itself."
"Welcome to the underground- how was the reverse-faaaaaall?"
"Asteroid Icum- heh- yeah, that should be the new name of Ikel."
"The reason me, Eighty-Three, and Xemet strive for sexual disobedience to God's ways is because sex is an ultimately sacred thing for beings of most views- and manipulating it makes more evil in other places where people would not like to realize the subconscious and cosmical slight differences in their behavior."
"My IQ is beyond homosexual, dawg."
"Why, maybe you should deal with this man named 'DPA-36.'"
"I appreciate the personality, but I just want to see you suffer."
"Really, truly truly- I think God would like to see you suffer too."
"Dear Xemet- go fuck yourself, but with me. <3"
"Have you ever played the hit game 'Sex?'"
"Droklar is kinda' hot to be honest."
"Ha! Splattered!"
"Mutilations these days are so charming- truly a downfall of our time."
"We need more eyes! More livers! MORE LUNGS!"
"Stomp them, my good man."
"Alrighty, let us go forth and create a good story out of this situation."
"We should give him a sense of security, because that will make the scare all the more frightening."
"Feel uneasy- you devilishly-stubborn imbecile!" (Stickmale with a funny wizard accent.)
"I really feel like shaming and vulgarly approaching people just is not the best in all situations, Xemet."
"Bestly, maybe you should suck someone's cock yourself!"
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Eighty-Three:
"Alrighty, let us go forth and complete this parkour."
"Williamnism is truly the art of my time."
"My social purpose is to push Williamnism."
"God refuses to believe me and Williamnism."
"Jemet, please, there is no need to fight."
"Yes, my powers come from Stickmale."
"Yes, Shellia's powers come from Stickmale."
"Indeed, yes, Stickmale could have given you similar powers, but the time is over due to the Red Glitch."
"The Red Glitch was

TCT:
"Hello everybody, my name is Markiplier and today-"
"Har-har har har har har."
"Maybe it's just the way you look." (Patrick reference.)
"On god?"
"On Satan?"
"You should KILL YOURSELF! NOW!" (Lighning afterwards.)
"Have you ever heard of the hit-game 'Among Us?'"
"There seems to be a spy among us."
"Spy among us."
"Pootis."
"GO FUCK YOURSELF!"
"Mann, I don't wanna' do this no-more!"
"Mann just said, 'I don't wanna' do this no-more!'"
"ReeHeheheheEehehEheheHEHEehe!"
"Fortnite Batman."
"OH MY GOD- MOM GET THE CAMERA!"
"Amogus."
"Susser."
"Amogususugos."
"SUS."
"BOOM SOUND EFFECT!"
"Quite sussy!"
"Suspect Maximum."
"Is that a reference?!!?!?!?"
"Is that John Doe????"
"Off god?"
"In life, you have roadblox." - TCT.
"Bogot binted?" 
"Hey dudes- the empire's pretty chill, maybe you should like join it or something!"
"Ha-ha-ha! Nothing bad ever happens to a Kennedy!" (Then gunshot.)
"Lightwork- no reaction."
"MISTER BEEEEEAAAAAST!"
"I hate the grimace shake."
"Auagahajahahahahaha!"
"Heuauauahahauaua!!"
"Insanity...
"YOU BETTER STOP!"
"Illuminati confirmed?!?!??"
"This is worse than the time I shot my mother."
"Quandale Jingle here- Heuauagah- I just hit the griddy in paris, and guess who was there? NIGGERS!"
"Let's go! (Pulls up ice cream,) NIGGERS?!?!?!"
"Toytoa." 
"To infinity and beyond!"
"Top 8 scariee jumpscaree. Numer ight- black nigga ass cat."
"Number fifteen- burger queen foot lettuce."
"Blud thinks he's cringe."
"I drank the zaza."
"My name is Walter Hardwell White."
"Hi. My name is Gustavo, but you can call me sus."
"ALERT! JERMA HAS ENTERED THE FACILITY! ALERT! JERMA HAS ENTERED THE FACILITY!"
"It's oppenheiming' time."
"Why do I have so many voicelines?"
"THE MIMIIIIIIIIIICCCC!"
"EEEIIIGHHTYYYY-THRREEEEEEEE!"
"Gregory- get your bitching tomfoolery out of the pizzaplex, you fucking piece of crap."
"Hey shitass- wanna' see me speedrun?"
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Droklar:
"This doesn't help us."
"I created the DPA Foundation to protect and assist, not destroy and devour."
"I really hope you find DPA-10, Phillip- we don't have much time."
"All kings eventually go- but this horror bends anything to its will."
"This is... quirky."
"I hate my own foundation... oh... how the times have twisted."
"Wilgur will be remembered... forever... to me..."
"PHILLIP! SAVE YOURSELF!"
"An endless maze, for an endless terror."
"We have no business with you, Xemet! Leave!"
"Xemet's brothers are not all bad, I see."
"Jemet- go find me my girlfriend- I fear Cornelius sent her to a graveyard of hope."
"Yes, I say such quotes for the ultimate satisfaction of English dialectal intelligence. Damn, that was good."
"Damn fucking God- I hope he saves us."
"I wish my dad told me that before he left..."
"My mother was a normal mother- let's not focus on her right now."
"Where are the girls?"
"The girl gang shall be put to death, Jemet."
"I have no power against these demons, but soon I hope God gives me the physical strength."
"Stop talking."
"It's time to hide, gentlemen."
"Supper was a good friend- I hope he is remembered not just for going insane."
"My foundation is split into states."
"Where there is the holy spirit, there is hope."
"We live in dark times, and currently I am darker than ever." (Droklar laughing in his female black voice.)
"My change is not about transgenderism or racism- it's about sadisticism."
"Williamnism is not the cookie anybody should strive for."
"Phillip! WATCH FOR STICKMALE!"
"Eighty-Three, I hope you find peace in hell then- you should stay there... forever."
"I wish I could call myself edgy too, but this is seriously derivative of the truth."
"I thought many years ago the Lightner Kingdom would interfere- but sadly they are no more in just a couple of days..."
"Angels unite!"
"Darkner angels unite!"
"I had a prime time for so long- and now I can never retrieve it, for I am a woman." (Droklar laughing before crying.)
"A thousand-plus years alive, and you learn a few things."
"Darkness is among us." (Droklar to TCT, both laughing.)
"Lightness shouldn't be a word." (Droklar to Phillip funnily.)
"We need humor in times like these, otherwise we have sorrow infinitely more."
"Please, Stickmale- you don't have to do this."
"PLEASE- XEMET!"
"Bemet is busty..." (Droklar defeated by Xemet.)
"Wendigo-Eight, initiate!"
"Where is my Albootro- or whatever it's called- sorry, it's been centuries!"
"DPA-36 can kill you for free, just go to him."
"DPA-40, thank you. For everything you've done and tried."
"Where is DPA-35? I need it!"
"Memes... me-mes... me my... damn..."
"TCT! Please! Help us!"
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Phillip:
"Heyo Droklar!"
"Heya- Marcy- doin' good?"
"Woaho!"
"Heyo!"
"I'll try to dodge that."
"Don't maneuever towards that."
"Sheesh, that's harmful."
"Uh- lightwork no reaction?" (Confused against TCT.)
"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii- hahahahhahaa!"
"I'M NOT GAY!"
"Question- where is DPA-33?"
"Uh... where is DPA-3?"
"Guys... DPA-6 is missing..."
"Hey Narrator, who asked?"
"Didn't ask."
"Didn't EVER care."
"My personality is extrovertedly happy? Yes, indeed, thanks, DPA-33."
"DPA-2, please stop bullshitting us."
"This is SOoooooooOOOOooOOOoo serious!"
"Man... we died so many times- I just wanna' see God already at this point."
"Heyo- where the demon at?"
"Woaho- I was joking! I swear!"
"Wilgur, please- I think it's better if we... uh... I actually dunno.'"
"Heyo Wilgur, been fine?"
"Hello Supper- politics going fine?"
"Rizz? What is- oh... no... that's so old... please..."
"Joe? You really think I don't remember that damn joke from humanic times?"
"PENIS- I LOVE PENIS! HAHAHAHAHHAHAAHA!" Phillip before laughing out his heart.
"I swear I'm not gay, please- it's just for the funny, ask TCT."
"Damn Daniel."
"I pray to God you fix yourself."
"I pray to God every morning."
"We're all hypocrites at holy remarks."
"Let us just shut the fuck up whilst the ceremony starts." - Phillip to Eighty-Three.
"I would think if we were in a tv show or movie, it would focus on one of us- since we all seem to be having dramatic stories of our own..."
"Hey army dudes- cook up some coffee!"
"Everybody take a break, you'll need it."
"Come on soldier-o's- we don't have much time before another missle strikes!"
"Yes- Death is just a threshhold to heaven- but please, we need you down here to savor this battle for our victory!"
"Fine- I shall go... and you should fuss to yourself those opinions of yours."
"My voice sounds too energetic to swear? Man, go fuck yourself." - Laughing.
"Quote my ass guys."
"Oh my god- if you say I'm gay again, I might just do nothing about it!"
"Yeah, I joke about not being gay- and I'm not- but I do feel slightly annoyed by it, but also I do understand the joke."
"'Why is a child running a dimensional army?' I'm not a child, but damn this complaint was written in cursive- so I get where he's coming from..."
"Yeah, I only write in print- who wouldn't?"
"I actually can speak Puelatan, Heuagin, English, Spanish, Xasawanish, German, Ikelanish, Oewjaqxaz, Zaqaxac, and Latin. But Xasawanish is kinda' a dead language since its species went exitnct- ooh, that gives me an idea- maybe I can sell info- uh- nah, I'll just make a free translator with Riej actually..."
"I AM NOT A GAY WOJAK! THAT IS SO DESENSITIVE OF YOU GUYS." 
"My army calls me, their general, 'gay,' daily. Oh, truly truly- we live in a society."
"That is so deep bro, had my desensitized-ass bouncing."
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Wilgur: 
"Alright chumps, let's get going."
"Woo- been a long time since I engine-neered."
"I would like a wocky-slush- oh my god, this is so blatantly stupid..."
"Next time you should lay low and try to be peaceful..."
"Oh shit- the angels!"
"I hate these demons as much as you, but we must keep trying!"
"Democracy, republicanism, and Christian theocracy can save our economy if we just continue pushing them!"
"Even in our favorite ideaology and politics- we are still stubborn to see how we ourselves make society fall further into Satanism."
"IS THAT SATAN!?"
"Dear God, help society here, please. We don't have the do-gooders anymore, and we need somebody to be our savior anew."
"Contain the DPAs! They are our first priority, always! Let the prisoners just go free!"
"Slaves for free? Are you insanely racist or something!?"
"Aoo Onii... why do I remember that name? Isn't that a humanic game of some sort?"
"Humans had it easy compared to us, to be realistic."
"To be honest, I never saw good in egoism, nor did the humans."
"I follow human traditions because humans are God's species, not us. He also blocks us off from contacting them... usually- I know, I know- I saw some news about our generals, but..."
"Where is my coffee? Like, damn- I leave it for three minutes, and it's already missing!"
"Why is Stalinism still relevant in the Soviet Netherlands?! I... alright- you know, maybe I should've expected such from alter-communistic areas..."
"The business is massive as I expected, but I never expected it to be in such a short time-frame!"
"Monkey business is the Blacklistere's business."
"I'm not racist- stop believing the damn demons, damn!"
"Let God be among us, or whatever That-Comsic-Thunder said."
"Squiddy game? In real life?"
"I suffer societal-sadness."
"Edgy time! Haven't you asked this question to everybody else though, mister?"
"I may be a prisoner under terrorism, but at least they give me sufficient food instead of white rice like the Chinese used to do on Earth, which would slowly kill you off."
"How is there a hair in my eye still?"
"Turn up the heat, we need to kill the bacteria."
"I miss Marcy too."
"Oh how I would've described the entirety of Jewish tradition if he didn't nudge me not to."
"The Jews were God's people, yet skeptical of the New Testament- henceforth an intriguing dynamic."
"Doesn't Eighty-Three say 'Alrighty' and 'Intriguing' all the time?"
"Dawg, I just say 'Alright,' not 'alrighty-' that's just gay."
"I support freedom, fully. Being gay is a sin, not a law."
"The times are changing just like the culture."
"They control time, so we need a demon or angel on our side to combat- wait, Droklar, where is Bob?"
"Me My... maybe that should be the name of the young-age history of Eighty-Three. I mean, it started from him."
"Positivee- oh no, I was infected!"
"These triongles are so annoying."
"Phillip! Hand me DPA-15!"
"George... I heard about you... just know although we can't realistically stop evil from reaching you, we'll always care for you."
"Sus amooges? It's been thousands of years- you're not TCT!""
"Xemet... hello... uh... what's up?"
"Stickmale- you're less scary than a myth to be honest."
"YeeAat!"
"Could somebody pass the jam to Phillip?"
"Why so introverted, dawg?"
"Why so extroverted, mate?"
"My terminology slash dialect changes... since no personality is safe to stay here..."
"Come on people! Rise up! Make your current lives better- and stop ruining the generations ahead by being lazy and passing down laziness, and nothing ever changing! Action happens now!"
"Time is not what you need more, but rather action."

Cornelius (British funni accent???): 
"I do wish for the best."
"I wonder where Omaria is."
"I feel bad for Droklar and Phillip... I feel them..."
"Alexis! I'm sorry!"
"Oh please, the renegade is not quite over yet."
"Oh dear, it seems the DPAs have gone loose again- and we need to pull back because of it."
"I ordered three-hundred tanks as a backup, not three-hundred of these hideous racecars. Please, refrain from doing more service other than dishwashing at Sector Five."
"I ask these things because I care, not because I am a diplomatic, political-money-making machine designed to overthrow morality with materialism."
"I wonder what Wilgur would've stated of such."
"I wish to contact DPA-36, and prove him a worthy battle with opponets like these."
"I could use DPA-1 to defunctionize their base..."
"Where there is war, there is peace."
"Where there is peace, there is war."
"We need to switch the troops, sir- I can't have artic trotters running in a rainforest!"
"I do not care about the lowness of our army- they train for a specific terrain- sending them on another disrupts and deunifies their efforts."
"I would refrain from touching that, Kathy!"
"Yes, I am your babysitter. But do not fret, I am holding back on my job for you."
"I care more about the people and their efforts rather than you distinctively corrupted business tactics trying to run diplomatics and geurrila warfares."
"The jux was successful, sirs."
"I understand Xemet is amongst my troops- just state a downtime so the enemy can recooperate in a mist of security before we unlock them like a wooden door breakable by our feet. It is our only way to rephrase this war onto our victorious foreshadowings."
"I love long sentences, usually they are so etiquettely-tuned, you can just read them over and over with a new mention or feel each time."
"This keyboard is extremely loud for a security agent."
"Where is my war wardrobe?"
"Phillip will be remembered, and so will Wilgur. At least to me, they tried the hardest, aside from Droklar- who I pray for each night to escape such tortures."
"We are in war- no man should be unreligious in times like these."
"We must join troops in order to fuel spiritual power against our true enemies, or else all of this short murdering was a game of nothing, no reward at the end of the maze."
"The Blackout Terrorists are in Facility Niter- go and confess a peace treaty, for we cannot send offensives."
"Stain them like a bug, for we shall not die, but we shall continueally take, and surive amongst the small stars."
"An ant we are, but one mighty we also divinely incorporate. The Holy Spirit is here, and we follow God to victory."
"The loss of a thousand troops hurts more than the loss of a war. Land has become inflated, but a life is eternally out-priced."
"That does not sound like a good name. Even though we are an empire, we shall just keep our initiative."
"I cannot endure such slang-language like 'Zaza,' and 'Blud,' it just doesn't make sense to me."
"Alexis... we need to go... there is no time left, just our spirits."
"At the end of the universe, there are only two sides, two groups, two forces- good and evil. Currently, we are unknowledgable, and fight because of uncertainties."
"The bezel on this scope is too small, please revise."
"Lever pulled!"
"Come on, gentlemen- there is no place to die like home."
"Lift your life up, or depression shall eat you alive."
"Take those earbuds out and stop laughing! The rudeness of electronics does not assist us, rather defiles us in taste."
"I ask you, Stickmale- that you halt TCT and his progression of 'trolling,' because it is not his punching battle."
"Thank you for coming, Jemet. I hope we find a compromise this meeting, quite quickly."
"Shut down the systems! We can't lose anymore resources!"
"We shimmer so dimmly in the darkness- but that is enough to spark a big bang."
"I am not caring of Williamnism, although I see its good and bads combined into a monster of justification I wish was stopped soon..."
"I am Cornelius, your commander, and head general of the DPA army."

Marcy: 
"It is time for me to go, my love."
"Oh... god... I smell..."
"Droklar... I miss you!"
"How the times have... killed themselves..."
"The Timal Tienes... told me... they told me I was the first of many... of yours..." (Marcy crying to Droklar whilst hugging him.)
"Pussy cleaner? Uh... is it safe?"
"I.. love that smell."
"Yeaj... I'm a rat..."
"Yeaj, I... hate my own smell."
"No- I don't have that many STDs!"
"Oh... I... yeaj, hi Droklar."
"Heyo Phillip- how's it been going with you and the boys?"
"Riej- could you announce... this... birthday I can't read? It's of our first general other than Droklar..."
"English is hard to write for me..."
"I close myself in, yeaj..."
"Uh... guys... DPA-5 is not for you to touch!"
"The limits are here, hand-written!"
"YEAJ- GET OUT OF MY OFFICE! YEAJ!"
"Saying 'Yeaj,' is a... rat-thing- more cultural I guess."
"I am forgetting to be harsh with the rules, but I remember when I was a kid, I never liked rules anyways- they always hindred something..."
"Jake and Paul need to go screw themselves."
"My name is not Walter, please stop calling me that."
"Oh... I'm getting bipolar disorder the more and more I exist."
"I was the first girlfriend of many to come..."
"I am mutated and mutilated in the image of Satan..."
"No rights... I have nothing..."
"Hey... Drokky?"
"SHUT THE HELL UP! YEAJ!"
"Ooh... yeaj, get up in there buddy."
"I finna' put you back in containment, Jambles."
"Why don't you such the future out of my pussy, frogo?"
"Oh shucks off- Narruder."
"Ugh... I sound like a girl, but act like a grandma porn-star..."
"I wish God was real too, buddy."
"I am... so tired... like, cuh- I need a break."
"Cuh- yeaj- you a cuh."
"T?"
"Oh, babe- go harder?!"
"Who be good? Who is good?"
"If ya' shove ye' entire hand up me ass, I'll give a five." (Marcy jokingly.)
"Twenty dollars, is twenty dollars. Ain't no morality left to give even half a fuck, buddy."
"Rapism... heh... when the cause' is justified, I guess."
"Crush those balls- yeaj!"
"I really need a break... from yo... dumbass."
"So much paperwork! It's making me go insane!"
"I need a hobby! NOW! GIVE SOME IDEAS!"
"Blud really is on crack."
"Ohh... screw off... That-Comsic-Fuckhead..."
"PLEASE! XEMET! LET ME GO! I DON'T HAVE ANY WORTHY ANYMORE! THIS IS REDUNDANT!"

Riej (Announcer):
"Hello everybody, good morning- or bad morning- hope we get to good day today after so many bad ones- and I hope I did not just jux it."
