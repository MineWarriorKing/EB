-->No Hacking of any kind.
-->Copyright content to your minimal best. (It is not advised at all to post copyrighted content, but if you are unsure and research can not help, then other statements will happen.)
-->Follow all United States FEDERAL LAWS. (This is an English Server.)
-->This list will be updated. There will be a ping for everyone at the time of an update.

How this server should work:

There will be a chat for everybody and a seperate one for lucky personnel. LUCKY PERSONNEL get to say who gets kicked/banned from the group in a channel which
allows for them only, and testing contributors (and higher ups) to message. Higher ups will see their complaint and move the person away from the group if the vote gets enough dislikes, resulting in the person's kick/ban on how severe it is.
Their comment will have a checkmark for "Yes, I would like to remove this person" or an "X" for a "No, I would not like to remove this person."
Members will be able to vote on these comments. If the person has over 50% of the checkmark, they are kicked or banned on how the upper personnel think.
If the person has below a 50%, they are safe till another vote. If the person has exactly 50%, then they are still safe.

Now, members will have their own ejection-like, among us-like channel. There, anybody can make a complaint after a long while, and they will have to put
their own emojis in order to validate their vote. People will be able to vote on these, and it will be up to the higher ranks in order to decide whether they
should take them seriously or not. Still works like the LUCKY PERSONNEL, but with more freedom for everybody.

[You cannot vote our Contributors, Controllers, or Kings. You can vote out LUCKY PERSONNEL, Testing Contributors, and members.]
