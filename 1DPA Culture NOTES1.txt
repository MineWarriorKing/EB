Book of evils:
-Make someone attach themselves to a grudge/anger, and never let them think of soluting it.
-Make somebody unaware of the non-realness, and spoil their minds so that if they find out, they amass depression, and then use the depression to kill themselves in factorous ways.
-Make illogical people out of boasters and wanters, who pride themselves so much they deny any opinion other than theirs/spread narcissism.
-Make somebody incorporate a lost cause as their mission or area for life, where they pay attention to stone walls and watch paint dry, waiting for difference when there is no possibility logically in sight.
-Make people grasp onto small details, and worry big about them. Don't let them think they're small, waste their time with these details, and if they know, make them cry.
-Dry somebody over and over, keep on pushing the evil over and over. It should make them angry if they know of you, and addict them to anger.
-Use porn/nature as a standing point to invoke natural responses as an ideology, and then twist the naturalness of what they see good into it's true form- lies, deception, greed, etc.
-Limit people and don't let them detail too much- don't let them explain the full picture or lead onto sources. Example- use etc. Although this may contradict, which is good- allowing somebody to unlock the full knowledge permits it into full form- disallowing causing distrust, wastes of times, anger, and unexperience. Just look at William White!
-Twist all personalities. Make happy business turn into laziness, make joyful abundance turn into depressed thinking, make classiness turn into insanity, make business turn into greed.
-Wonder and futuristics- make them look towards the future, not past or present. Don't make them wonder on their current problems, just the ones ahead; so they don't feel the need to fix their problems, and henceforth keep having them.
-Destabilize spiritual work and intesify laziness, whilst also intesifying physical work. Make them eat a lot, make them watch slop all day, make their attention spans shrivel, as you also put them in the worst working conditions at physical work, and then make them have no time or regard for helping their spiritual problems with families or friends.
-Suicide. Make them want to kill themselves after using laziness and depression. That way if they're unsaved, they can't be saved so-to-say.
-Criticise all falsely. Like illogical, but make people think the world revolves around them and their symbolism. Push them to criticize the bible, and think of it wrong to modern standards, as well as invoke mental illnesses and bad personalities as normality.
-History becomes woke. Make people be illogical and dislike history- deny it. That way, it repeats, and insanity can assure itself.
-Psychotics. Bring in drugs and psychopathy into the thoughts, make people look towards killing others for safety, make them look towards natural animal instincts, and make them think delusionaling themselves will help themselves, or pain it away before allowing it back in. If it's justified in God's terms, then twist it so they think all is justified by God.
-Make them forget who they are, or what they're fighting for. In sinful acts, make them worry about it, and not what they said before about stopping it, or make them enjoy it, and then release and be sad, and repeat plus rinse.
-Darkness. Drive people to follow other religions, and to destroy everything they have. Make them follow idols and live in darkness as either a personality trait or as a fix.
-Schedule their minds. Make them think they have a time limit- that things can't just be stopped whence they want. Make them wait, make them think years away they'll fix it. It's like not letting them get up and do, but with more of a justification. Make them schedule their spiritual life, and add etiquette that doesn't exist to it as well.
-Taint language. Make them tell white lies, or miss the meaning of words like 'love' and 'hate,' switch language and meanings to harass and change upcoming history.
-Comedics. Make them laugh at sin, at themselves, at others- make them enjoy the slop by comedic purposes, and still look at it- make them enjoy human suffering, or uncanny darkness. Make them laugh at so-called 'edgy' people, and then hypocritically make a 'funny bomb threat.'
-Never change their schedule. Deorganize them too, but surely make do that they only see one good schedule, and never update it for the better. Make them fly to it like mosquitoes, and make them idolize it, and forget what they can do.
-Make them enjoy suffering; make them want to be dominated, make them want to be killed, make them want to demonized and evil and suffer in the lake of fire. Make them enjoy hell.

Facility One = The army of operations, where Cornelius and Phillip are mainly located. Timal Tienes lair below as well. Here, stress and privalege make up a bad atmosphere.

Facility Two = The Extra of operations, where Wilgur, DPA-3, DPA-11, DPA-40, and DPA-33 standby. Co-owned by PA. Here, it is 1984 by George Orwell-style.

DPA SHIPS:

The Aboolroltroo (PLANE 1):
-Abilities: Electric Shock-Shots, Releasing Wool as a sticky-substance, Lasers from electrical shooters, and blasting pure fire more.
-The 1st made strat-fighter spaceship with the help of Shean, Droklar, DPA-11, and etc. It is now the standard ship for Guards.

Balvyprop (PLANE 2): 
-Abilities: Lasering plasma, Going sound-speed, Pulling back without hesitation, reversing speed, and folding its wing to be thinner.
-The Balvyprop was designed by the PA and DPA Foundation in an alliance meeting, and was created by many developers listed elsewhere. This ship is very valuable, yet is mainly used for soldiers, and shows off the luxury of the DPA Foundation as well as provide an alternative to Plane 1.

Cugpuddler (PLANE 3):
-Abilities: Color-chaning, Sound-altering, Speeds up to sound, Mobility Wings and Base, Size-alterations, Magnetism, and Force-fielding.
-A ship created for Vice-Commanders and illusion, as well as stealth technically. This ship uses its wings, high speeds, color-alterations, sizing, and sound-altering abilities to be an annoyance towards the Problem Adversaries as a joke mostly, but others use it for serious intentions as spyware or faking-suicide in missions.

Domp-Fomp-Lomp (PLANE 4):
-Abilities: Extending Force-Field, Armorizing Different Elements, Self-destruct, Re-instruct, and Mass-inization.
-The ship was another test, allowed by Phillip and some Blackout Terrorists to build, and enlisted into the system by Wilgur, as a ship that suicide runners would take, and then reform in, and then also be a DPA-transportation ship. This ship is also used for intimidation, and trade.

The "EYOZURMIAOPY" (PLANE 5):
-Abilities: Stretch, Color-altering, Stretchy-blasts, Transform and transfer, Seperation, Indestructible, and Scroplifiunerable.
-Still testing. This ship was a gift from Problem Adversaries as a gift for allowing the KNOLS element to be traded. This ship will be used for many reasons, and is still in the blueprints of how it's built. Currently, people step inside, the vision goes orange, and then they see all sides and vertices of the ship. It also denies shadows and any other color to be on its substance other than that orange. It is not sentient.

Fincher-Linker-Tinker-Bither (PLANE 6):
-Abilities: Lightspeed movements, double shields, quark-manipulation, torment-wave interpretation, etc.
-Created by Stickmale, DPA-13, and Cornelius, this minituare ship the size of a homosapien's index-fingernail at childhood, is an altering ship with unknown dimensions, breaking barriers of natural logic by angelic intervention. This ship is mainly used for secrecy and speed, but was built mainly as a purpose. Droklar saw intelligence in it though.

Houljv'st's'mist'ist'ks'fl (PLANE 7):
-Abilities: Sound spinning (Spin faster than sound to generate etc.,) Sizer (Change size,) Sounding Refounding (Transmit/Alter waves.)
-Created by Weuyerufvwjvwqjhvwewesellium Uiwehewbaxazaqium [Micro] (PA), and Yumo from Droklar's input, this ship was created as a quick test to see if they could arise to sound at the least, and at the most conquer wavees altogether. Half at most, they found a working solution after 21 failed attempts, Yuma generated a name in Syncoathiam and then translated it to English. The Ship uses [] and [] to change size, transmit waves, and spin-fly. Droklar took up this bright idea quickly and added it to the ships, redoing the process with other engineers like Cornelius and such. This ship is truly just another, but used efficiently for sneaky entrances, or funny instances.

ñibbgvejistñ (PLANE 8):
-Abilities: Grow-possible, Ghost (Turns invisible or can't be touched/waved against somewhat,) Exotic matter armor, Time-altering, Codee-wrong.
-Created by Caleb Peter, [A Timal Tiene,] and Xemet, the three finalized a project in Ujajean and translated it to English, and henceforth created the ship. Through the thought of five minutes, they all formed quick blueprints, and then formed it with their breathing of lungs, all accepting and all consenting. I, the narrator, am proud something actually got done between Xemet and somebody else that wasn't evil. Anyways, this ship is used for transportation of DPAs and other creatures, as well as innovation in exploration.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
DPA Robots:

DPA=A1/5 [A15%] (Inevitable Helper Bots):
-Summary: Specially buolt with A.I. blueprinted technology from DPA-(+2) and The KODING MACHINE, this pre-made robot was designed to flaw out communities of objects or people, but were revamped last-minute by Phillip's orders to become maidens of the DPA Facilities. Currently, they
are being worked on by engineers such as Shean, Alexis, and Droklar; for more purposes. 

DPA-A2/5 [25%] (Interventione Bote):
-Summary: A2/5 is a slow-walking turtle-like robot, that cleans the atmosphere and has refinement machinery past natural physics. It usually gives off a scent of rain-forestry and deep-greens whence nearby, and comes in many sizes. It can detach its legs, and grows bacteria that is designated to eat incorrect material and clean up all places as swelly as bioligically necessary. It's polka dots are disgusting as a few say, but necessary for growth spottings.

DPA-A3/5 [35%] (Electroeeee Sweeporeeee):
-Summary: This machine uses high-speed voltages and such to attract magnetic/darkened/lightened/sound/electric/and metal pulses and objects of such, and uses it for finding origin of such. It's extended pole is its handle, and its four mouths that are blocked by glass unless the machine slides it open, or plus actual mouth below, can suck and taste for the artificial intelligence, which has been rumored/had biased-entries to be sexually assaulted.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DPAs:

DPA-(-5) [Horizone overe Dawne]:
--Essence Type: Destroyed EM Wave Being.
--Created by Jemet to be an additive DPA, soon destroyed by Xemet in an attack, this being used to be in the form of an EM Wave with only troffs and crests, henceforth making Taep Wavee important to this DPA, and came in the form of a glowing red stale face of an emoji that would exist to only be viewable upon a horizon of any sort, whether on a beach, down a forest, down an infinite amount of open-doored hallwas, and ecetera. It was said to disillusion some into having decrepit nightmares, whilst others saw it as symbolism of good coming to the facility. Many views were mixed upon Jemet's creation, and he nor Xemet nor anybody else plausible to understand it has said anything on the being's nature, making him a neutral wonder.

DPA-(-4) [Facilitye Muaho 9]:
--Essence Type:

DPA-(-3) [Taep Wavee]:
--Essence Type: Destroyed Torment Tool.
--This tool once used to show only a certain amount of waves with troffs and crests, as well as analyze every other type of energy. Given by the SNF to the DPAF as a gift of alliance, this 0.97 by 0.98 feet pad has four buttons listed in the image, with a dusty and rusty yellowish tablet area and grey fuzzy screen with green glowing lines to symbolize the troffs and crests of EM waves. No details were given upon this machine except it was brought by 'Dr. Kleinere' from a 'Blacke Mesae' region on 'Halofolive' in the SNF, and was soon disparted by Kemet to not work as a DPA anymore, henceforth making it a normal analyzer tool.

DPA-(-2) [No forces or questionability]:
--Essence Type: Destroyed Torment Place
--This place once existed to be floating 143.5 miles off the exosphere of Xenor, being made up of a mantle of igneous stone rock with hooks going down, along with constantly moist, somewhat-flat green grass flourishing directly on top of the rocks. 144 feet by 143 feet, whenever somebody existed within the abstract barrier of this island, their parts would de-exist without sound and no longer be retrievable. The island logically has no gravity, atoms, or other energy besides the torment waves making it up, created by an unknown being registered both by the CCF and DPAF. After a few years in study, a code break occured randomly, and sucked it in before being repaired by the Koding Machine, leaving DPA-(-2) and Xenor non-existent to this day.

DPA-(+6) [Mossye Malle]:
--Essence Type: Friendly Being.

DPA-(+5) [Headless Strippere]:
--This woman is headless and her neck actually is hole inside to her un-organed body, fleshy and bouncy. She was created by Demet far back, and now exists for the only purpose of sex. Her elements are extremely radioactive though, so ordinary beings cannot equally enjoy her body. She is also fully shaved.

DPA-(+2) [Droklar's Tuysi 79 Sentient Monitor]:
--A sentient monitor related to Applee or Cromehebook computers, which also instead runs sextillions amounts of tetrabytes per second, and has many leveraging options.
--Essence Type: Torment Tool

DPA-(+1) [Infinetee Trashacanae]:
--DPA-(+1) is an infinite trashcan created by Xemet to be a positive DPA that started the positive DPAs, and henceforth became directly at Droklar's office. This trashcan has no bottom.
--Essence Type: Torment Tool

DPA-(0) [The ____ ambience of the DPA Foundation.]
--Going by many names, this is actually rather not a DPA but a myth spread amongst the foundation members that the silenter and darker halls make you go insane supernaturally, and evil. This started because people saw how quickly the foundation's social structure was changing to demonic levels of harassment, and so people blamed it on an unexistence DPA ironically.
--Essence Type: Falsified Ambience.

DPA-1 (Killere DooRe):
--A door needed to be seperated by a mile in order not to have control of other doors. (Torment Waves)
--If closed on you, has a chance to send you to a maze called the 'Black Box,' where you are now inside it's own mind and can be ripped out by Torment Waves.

DPA-2 (Jumblere Glassese):
--Cursed by God to be invisible except for his glasses; his works being evil in business against angels as he created vision goggles.
--An invisible man which even if you put water/paint on him, he is still invisible. The excess becomes invisible until is no longer could
assist with knowledge of his existence.
--His glasses can be knocked off/There are needed for his vision/There cannot become invisible/They are indesctructible.

DPA-3 (The Blood Keeper):
--Heru, reanimated by the Stickmale.
--Essence Type: Dangerous Orchestral-Energy Being.


DPA-4 (DATA RELOCATED):
--Essence Type: (DATA RELOCATED)
--Scroplofinlunerable.
-All Data is relocated about this DPA, unless you have the Creator Pass.
--DPA-4 is a place of honor and rebirth, a heavenly box in the cold abyss of the universe, moveable.

DPA-5 (The Cross Gunner):
-Essence Type: Weapon.
--Created by Lightners, soon blessed by a few angels in the SN for alliancing.

DPA-6 (Foreshadower):
-Wilbur's Robot.
--Essence Type: Friendly Torment Being.
--DPA-6 is a robot that simply was cursed by code to tell the time of the present, future, past, or etc. in the form of a riddle, poem, or quote.

DPA-7 (Infiniter Hands and Shoes.):
--Yes, it's spelled 'Infiniter.'
--Essence Type: Dangerous Torment Being
=Modifiers= [Endless.]

DPA-8 (DATA SMASHED LOL!):
--Essence Type: Weapon.
=Modifiers=
--DPA-8 smashes anything, including data itslef- like as in jumbling the words, making a person unable to heal, destroying radio waves where it is simply held, and breaking down any material.
+Card Levels Required: Vice+.

DPA-9 (The Amigoos):
--Essence Type: Friendly Orchestral Beings.
=Modifiers= [Non-active,] [Group of species,] [Uncontainable.]

DPA-10 (Diamond Escaper):
--Essence Type: Tool.

DPA-11 (Dreams and Hopes become Failures):
--Essence Type: Friendly Orchestral Being.

DPA-12 (The Rainbow Orb but now a ball):
--Essence Type: Orchestral-Particle Being.
--The Rainbow Orb knows of DPA-33, DPA-3, Stickmale, Xemet, and DPA-40.

DPA-13 (Marcus Danie Ijea Okai):
--Essence Type: Friendly Torment Being.
--Cursed with the form of being made out of paper; reason = Not doing a push up whence dared by some random friend.
--Honduran, 13 years old, has albinism, blue eyes.

DPA-14 (All-Staro):
--Essence Type: Friendly Torment Being.
--Given powers by Kemet, in wanting of her to kill a story from another.
--Real name: Izxok Jobed Cexeoa Qaxaza.
--Pointa: "Can evil and good live together peacefully? Like a certain kind of evil that is good in this morality scheming, or maybe their peace or harmony is war? Is that what reality is?"

DPA-15 (Magicale Trickinge Wrappere):
--Essence Type: Unknown Being.
--DPA-15 moves on its own, with its own mind. Tests have shown for it to have opinions on apples over oranges, books over videogames, etc.

DPA-16 (Trionglees.):
--Essence Type: Sentient Torment Virus
--Triongles is a virus of seemingly pencil-materialized triangles forming on whatever physical surface they can come into contact with, usually starting atom by atom before increasing to molecule by molecule and so on. As this contagious virus spreads, it does not realistic harm though, depending on the being. It simply adds an overlay of pencil, which can affect inside systems or fashion, but is mostly neutral; like its sentience, it has been shown to enjoy paper and enjoy soft other materials, spreading faster and choosing options based on a dialect of 'Ozovob.' It is bound by a curse of the codee, and currently can't be stopped, only limited.
--Not specially from CC since the magical wrapper technically found it; somewhere as the wrapper wrapped, it collected Trionglees from another object, and now spreads it onto all things wrappable.

DPA-17 (The Improver of Improiv):
--Created by Improiv the angel of technology.
--Essence Type: Tool.
--Creates things by emotional/spiritual means, defying the logic of code. It's a blessing of holiness to all, so demons don't use it.

DPA-18 (Futuro Visionao):
--Essence Type: Friendly Torment Being
--Description Summary: DPA-18, or Futuro Visionao, is a plush-like frog made of soft yet fleshy unknown materials that bound multiple emotions/feelings whence touched, and can see to the future in all cases. His green and yellow body, plus blue and purple zigzagging eyes have never changed color/material/or feeling, but his motions are janky and crooked, defying normal humanoid expressions. Futuro Visionao will not lie unless you lie, and his relationships with others are not good as the person is not good. He cannot be hurt spiritually or physically, and cannot be uncursed due to The Red Glitch and codee. He also may at times defies normal lighting on his body, making him invisible at times or a lit opaque in complete darkness.
--Cursed by an unknown angel to know all of the future, but not past. There is a workaround.
--Is pure to God, but treats neighbor as treated in most cases. Personality = Angelic.


DPA-19 (The Narrartor!):
--Essence Type: Friendly Torment Being
--Created by Stickmale.

DPA-20 (Life-e Tree-e of Tree-e Life-e):
--Essence Type: Friendly Torment Being.
--Created by Juak the angel of Jumping, and founded dominating a planet to happiness.
--Dropped off by the Steel Terrorists.

DPA-21 (Cardiac Arresting Pills):
--Essence Type: Tool.
--Whence thrown, they have a 42%-82% chance of blowing up, and causing the atmosphere to quickly give people cardiac arrest.

DPA-26 (Farie Farrie):
--Essence Type: Dangerous Orchestral Being.

DPA-27 (Reversal Carde):
--Essence Type: Torment Tool

DPA-28 (Criem Keiak):
--Essence Type: Unknown.
--Scroplofinlunerable.
--DPA-28, or Criem Keiak, is named after the woman who discovered it. We don't know what it is though- for nothing can state. Xemet, Stickmale, Bob- no angel or demon can amiss what it is. We have tried asking Satan himself to identify, and he denies, calling it 'disgusting.' Ultimately, our best guess is from Demet, who told Jemet that it was "A present from God unlike DPA-4."
--DPA-28 also has destroyed all other possible DPAs and demons plus angels, making the DPA Foundation the center and spotlight war of hell and the Holy Spirit.

DPA-29 (Pressire Airer):
--Essence Type: Dangerous Torment Tool

DPA-30 (Bloode Berriese):
--Essence Type: Dangerous Torment Plant

DPA-31 (Not Cornelius' Car):
--Essence Type: Orchestral Tool.

DPA-32 (""): 
--Essence Type: Unknown.
--Scroplofinlunerable.
--We cannot describe it, as it is a angelic-demonized being that is as powerful as Xemet or Stickmale, and henceforth is using his power similarly to instead undefine his form. He is honored these powers by the Red Glitch himself, and has been sent here to order peace.
--"It's fueled by reactivites, it has cubic rains and rainbow rectangles that alter a person into schizophrenia, it has gooey eyes that have up to six pupils a second, and its mouth is melted easily by ice cream, but emits a rusty yet bouncy noise everywhere when chewing. It constantly bleeds on its hands, and its shoes are 1,921 years old dating back to 2091 Humanity. He or it does pushups whence contained, and his suit plus pants are highly electric. He is easy to defeat, but respawns? Heua spread Coividid nienenee but ucuressur esdepressionnnnn..." (person goes into coma of words.)

DPA-33 (Eighty-Three):
--You already know.
--Given demonic/angelic powers by Stickmale. Creator of Darkness Kingdom. Owner of Williamnism.

DPA-34 (Producableeeee Machiny):
--Produces Red Berries with four-leave plants to grow in any type of soil or ground from absolutely nothing.
--Powered by a break in Codee, and also a break in time. Changes dimensions and travels through portalises randomly, henceforth uncontainable yet unsentient. Containment procedures include using Stickmale/TCT/etc. to keep it contained for short periods.
--This large grey machine with eight buttons on top also has two unique classifications. When fifty inches around this machine, any bush turns into the light or dark red versions of the four-wide-leaved bush growing instantenous red berries- the bushes shifting smoothly and changing color quickly yet understandably, giving off a scent of blueberry. This process has not other factors found to intrigue its process yet. Any being who digests these red berries for the first several times may have a tummy ache and small chance of diarrhea. After seven times though, the being will become hyperactive and happy, curing any devastion, depression, and etc., even as they retain their memories of it. They will stay like this for around six hours, and then go back to normality instead of sadness if they recently were in such a state.

DPA-35 (Invis Cer Bol):
--Essence Type: Dangerous Orchestral Tool.
--Scroplofinlunerable.
--DPA-35 is just an invisible cereal bowl that is invisible because of a code break. Everybody believes it is because of a demon or angel because over time the bowl has an effect to switch a person's thought about that only away from the truth and into that. DPA-35 otherwise is unbreakable, but also becomes visibly just white and porcelain when DPA-27 is used on it.

DPA_36______
--Essence Type: Dangerous Torment Spirit.
--Scroplofinlunerable.
--DPA-36 makes any normal being go retarded/their brains slowly die and stop working whence they try to understand him, hear him, draw him, see him, visualize him, or exist near him. Otherwise, people can think of DPA-36 without actually thinking of DPA-36. This has caused demons and angels to profit a law stating nobody know of this DPA-36 truly, and henceforth people imagine wrong. DPA-36 can also affect demons and angels if he gets powerful enough in wisdom and power.
--DPA-36 has a heroic yet dumb/hypocritical sounding personality, because he is disillusioned, thinking he is a fallen angel who can save others and help God plus return to heaven himself. Instead, DPA-36 is actually a demon gone mad, and Satan keeps him in a certain unknown circle of hell since Satan sees DPA-36 as a clown.

DPA-37 (Flying TONKO):
--Essence Type: Dangerous Orchestral Tool.

DPA-38 (Eraoa): 
--Essence Type: Friendly Orchestral Being.

DPA-39 (Disguised La Light of Lightners):
--Essence Type: Dangerous Orchestral Tool.

DPA-40 (The Love God.):
--Essence Type: Friendly Torment Being.
--Shellia, but grown up, without cat ears and tail and accordion.

===============================================Good Guys/Facility Helpers/Main/Etc.==============================================


Timal Tienes:
---Would rather use force to get me to do the correct thing.
---Are fallen humans of heaven, removed of their good personalities and set out with a "corrupted" way, said by Jesus.
---Dislike Erua and want to kill her because she is trying to save me in a pacifist-like way.

Eighty-Three (Me?):
--Green Dress was from Shellia, symbolizing the turning point of life.
--13 Years of age.
--Green eyes with blondish-reddist hair not well combed most of the time, until he changes his hair to be yellower and more stable.
--He creates versions of himself to study different subjects to then combine back into him.

George:
---Eyes are grey. HIS AGE WAS 14. His hair is yellow.
---Comes from Switzerland, and hopes everything will be good and has a dream to start singing.
[[[[[in me my 2, when George leaves
he goes to the top tundra wasteland of Russia and starts a Siberian factory place lasting to the horizon. It is his dream to create an
empire of music and raise his family and his country to the heights of cultural signifigance, so he has concert places and free
instruments around. He sends out letters to many town and such as he goes to enter the place.
I, on the other hand, go over to find his essence, so I rush back and go to my portal machine and try making one to a universe where a 
person is stronger than me. The Red Glitch stops me and says he'll only allow this once, and he remembers everything. So I tone it down and
get to a Greek version of myself with rainbow eyes and demon-like purple hands, then ask him and gather Gustavo up to hold a camera,
 which helps me go back to George and we grab his eyes out and make him drool darkness, like in the DPA. Then, he leaves and Gustavo is
 happy.
 I turn to see a DPA member
with their own camera, but they awkwardly wave and instantly leave. I decide to get the FINDER machine and find the DPA foundation
before exiting back with the info.]]]]]]

ThatCosmicThunder (TCT):
--Age = 19
--Mental; all he thinks about is memes, in front of Jesus, in front of the evil-self of him trying to explain how it wasn't his fault his
mother died in Me My 3, and he just overall stays a comfort meme character yet important in the most dire situations.
--Jesus understands TCT as a memelord, and sees his only problem that he acts for the 'funny,' which means he sometimes follows demons or shoots people for comedy. That is why when TCT plays around with God's daughter, God doesn't come down. [This scares Xemet to run away to the SN as the Red Glitch mocks, and Satan pulls out enterprizes in fear as well.]

Spamton Guy (Qoaiuek):
---Age = 294
--Cannibalized his own family before selling their body parts off for money. ThatCosmicThunder and Crow do not know about this.
---Wishes and speaks of 'Demet' calling to assist him in becoming the main character or allowing him to gain more power.
---He knows of the future, but cannot speak of it, as the Red Glitch blurs his mind from it.

Crow Guy:
--Age = 24
--Has a friendship with the black spy girl.
--and has a portal gun and a pistol. NEVER SPEAKS.

DROKLAR Von Jieak Jeka [Main Character]:
--Sumumpku is step-father since he raped Droklar's mother.

PHILLIP PHILLIP Oloi Jeua:
--Droklar's closest/best friend since childhood.
--Silly with how he dodges bullets; hitting poses and dance moves even.
--Serious about some things to a manner of finishing and calming the situation nicely.

WILGUR Tuy Oaia:
--Inspired by SCP-Reader Cube man. His personality is intelligent yet broadsting and firm, delighting and patriotic in science.
--Built DPA-6 before it got recked with code, and then he was unable to study firmly.
--Dies by overdosing in cold weather, and gets beatiful flashbacks before he warms up and fades away.

Bobe Thye Angel:
--His name is Bobe Thye Angel.
--He gave up his will and the heavens whence he saw Demet enter and exit so freely. He decided if God was dealing with demons, it was time to fix his world for him, and that he as a guard was not needed anymore.

Supper Koi Loi Loi (Among Us-thing:)

--Undergoes randomizations at pure chaotic levels, even his words become untasteful, and he loses characterization of all things. (Listen to DOKI DOKI STUPENDIUM SONG).

Bobby Mard Fard Fard (Black Ball:)
--Reflective at will, can be entirely black like Plague Doctors.

Suyer Uyer Fueh (Funny Farmer:)
--Cares about his hat and his brother the most. Personality = Uneasy, hard-working, careful, angry, country.
--Accented like shit.

Josh Harbucj Juea Kwhed (Farmer's brother:)
--

Leoj (Rapist):
--Goes from happy and enjoyful artist to artistring rape in real life.
--Story is: Xemet starts to twist his tiredness and overwork into masturbaition, and from there Leoj just goes all out trying to gain every dose of dopamine, which includes using new AI to generate the kind of porn he wants specifically. Eventually he gets dull and bored, and Xemet has the chance to input suicide or uselessness, but instead pushes the intelligence of making him use AI to generate solutions to his psychology addictions. From this, Xemet twists the AI to develop realer solutions involving real tasks, which he starts to perform, and then Xemet further twists him to enjoy these tasks, and then enjoy sexual immorality, and then gore, and then slowly devolve him away from Christ whilst also leaving it fundamentally stable in Leoj's view. Eventually Leoj gives up and rape becomes his game.

===============================================Bad Guys/Demons/Evils/Etc.================================================================

Heru/DPA-3:
---Pointy FULLY BLACK Shoes, like a triangle.
---Sadistic after unknowing much about what happens afterwards.
---Likes Trains from first battle againsg Jesus and Hitler.
---Sits in a room and listens to music whilst thinking deeply about what Fire God said about his justification during Kids Age.
---Comes up with theories and off-setting questions about his life mission as he sits alone and Deandra worries.
---Doesn't understand the 'arts' of different cultures that the Rainbow Orb brings him towards.

Stickmale/MineWarriorKing:
---Was casted out of Heaven for appealing to the devil with remarks for sadistic pleasures constantly.
---The Red GLITCH WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH STICKMALE.)
---THe COMMENTARIES TAKE PLACE WHEN AMIBO ASINO IS TAKING FIRST PLACE> before me my. [In heaven, this is why he got kicked out.]
---Jesus shuts down the commentaries after Stickmale does one more rerun with Professor Balls black-holed.
---Is a fallen Angel, meaning his has angelic/demon powers. HE FELL TO THE COMMENTARIES WORLD, and he hid his powers.
--In Commentaries, he controls all with black holes for eyes, and scares off everybody else, and Jesus already dislikes him.
--After first Me My timeline, he combines with Eighty-Three to go back in time and torture his past-self for a sadistic story.
---Stickmale destroys the concept of love at the end of the commentaries, and then remakes it at the end of Me My.?
---Is the Old/Commentary Stickmale combined with Eighty-Three. He is 100% Stickmale and 100% Eighty-Three, like Jesus
is 100% Man and 100% God- he does this by his angelic powers.
++STICKMALE has no limits against God- which is why he goes to play against God's daughter. Xemet wouldn't directly face God on even, nor would Satan. Eighty-Three is with Xemet on trying to make suffering last as long as possible, but even though Stickmale has created so many stories, he justifies himself by saying his intrusion against God's story would be massively better, and henceforth is a glass cannon on why even demons and angels dislike their own paradise. [Eighty-Three is a glass cannon for both Xemet and Stickmale since Stickmale controls Eighty-Three's important powers, yet Xemet could possibly give his own- and Eighty-Three is sadistic against God, but also formal- so this dynamic of a three-way interversion is created between the three infinite evils.]

The Blacklistere:
--Racist, easily angered, all-business now, trying to solve own issues by increasing them, a take on having everything you want without punishment. (american psycho!?!??!)

Kiosa:
--Eighty-Three wannabe using Molly's appearance, and tries to be better than 83.

Drenched Demons

NOTE: Demonic Females and other Demons: (some of these demons are merely just spirits, others are concepts that are replaced by other demons, and some are killed off.) All of these demons have drenched themselves in the cum, piss, blood, diarhea, and other matters in order to join the Drenched Demons group, along with Xemet and Satan's request. Some demon concepts are suicide places, like Female Demonic Fire God and Female Demonic ThatCosmicThunder and Demonic Omaria- those places have Xemet/Stickmale/Eighty-Three kill the demons as soon as a demon even signs up- henceforth they do not appear since they are implausible characters. Also, only 69 Drenched Demons. We have 65 images.

Then Clasif watches as his dad continues playing, only to lose his smile and start to walk over to then turn his dad around to a faceless Demonic Female Stalin. Female Clasif/Baldi just stares into his face with sadness before anger. "You were never really there, were you?" And she walks away as his dad sits there npc and emotionless. Then Clasif starts talking as he leans on a balcony. "I can barely even grow up anymore... I'm barely paying my taxes, along with barely feeding my adopted daughter... my job sucks..." and so Clasif almost cries. Then his dad says "I always knew you had that evil in you." And Clasif turns around in surprise before anger. "SHUT UP! All you do is sit on your FUCKING piano and say shit that just gets me by!" Clasif before breaking down emotionally. "Your mother was more evil than me." His dad says. "SHIT IT- DAD. I'm... I'll always be an outcast.. a joke... and unimportant teacher... laughed at and uncared for... because I listened to you.

The 24 Demonic Brothers:

Aemet
--The Ass-at-everything Demon.
--Transgender, bad at doing things, rude, hates intervention with brothers, ironically military commander of BT, hates Satan. Fallen demon.
--Dies after slightly messing up against Xemet in Droklar's office.
Bemet
--The Busty-Nigga Demon.
--Got a big ass, hates brothers slapping ass, only uses ass-attacks, hates women, loves Satan. A True demon.
--Dies from Xemet raping him to death.
Cemet
--The Cum 3 Demon.
--Made of cum, exists for cum, loves Satan, dies by overdosing on cum as a joke. Still a true demon.
Demet
--The Deal Demon. 
--Makes deals with many, including Qoaiek, TCT, Crow, and others like Xemet to kill his brothers.
--Big part of story. He BEGGED AND GAVE HIMSELF TO GOD in order to become the most evil because Gemet had made fun of him for not being evil enough.
--Still a true demon, but to Satan is like an evil white kid trying to take over a home he doesn't own and others don't give him the title.
Eemet
--The Everlast Demon.
--Haunts Earth's winters and arctics, part of the Dimensional Everlast Everlastians, helped create Everlast on Earth for good, is a fallen demon.
--Dies from Xemet's battle on Earth.
Femet
--The Koema Demon.
--Unknown what he does, but dies from eating too much after Xemet plants food around and makes his life a bit worse subconsciously.
--Fallen demon.
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Gemet
--The Golden Gradient Demon.
--A demon against the Golden Gradient, manipulative, loves being around brothers, reverses time still, gets led to de-existence by xemet.
--GOLDEN HOUR LISTEN: Gemet's purpose is fulfilled and so he rests happily, but realizes he's demonic and then wants God- and it comes to show how a true demon can't enter God's domain no matter how hard he tries, for he becomes a fallen demon, but can't obtain a soul link because Xemet holds the spirit matter, his only wish besides what else he searches for in the Red Glitch, Koder Machine, etc., and is evil without his own knowledge. He's an anti-hero too.

------Jesus DOES  NOT  MAKE people FORGET they were ever an angel before they are sent down as humans to be born.

Satan/Lucifer: 
--Rizztacular; Satan has a personality of slow evils, seeming naturally lovely and chill, but twists truths and bends lies to his right. [Inspired by Mile Morales' enemy, The Prowler.]
--Loves nobody; hates his own demons with unidentifyable passions; hypocritical, easily invasive, opens up hell for business by connecting it with Dimensional Foundations.
--Satan pulls out businesses when God gets scary, and also despises Stickmale's goofy intelligence, and rather not send a secret police or himself to fight, for he fears that if Stickmale sees even a sense of somebody trying to stop him, he'll go straight for the girl, and so Satan leaves Xemet to try continue convincing.
--Satan came from pride, and dwelled that backwards in the eyes of God, becoming better/more powerful at 'being' God by acknowledging everything good and bad and making it exist.

Holy Spirit:
--Unfathomable to demons, kills demons if they try to attack or it/'God' enters.
--Protects people who try, whilst others he/it/God allows to let go of themselves and him/it.

Unholy Spirit:
--Created by the flow of Satan, mysteriously divine in power.
